# Research: Auto-takeoff technical feasibility (build vs buy, data, GPUs, accuracy)

_Deep-research report · ? agents · saved for the project. Vendor/marketing claims flagged where unverified._

## Bottom line

For bid-grade flooring takeoff (room-level area error under ~2-5%), no fully-automated approach is reliably bid-grade today: the evidence consistently shows that usable accuracy requires human review/correction, and even the leading commercial vendors sell their "bid-ready" output as a human-in-the-loop service, not pure AI. The strongest BUILD path is a hybrid: parse vector/CAD PDF geometry directly (PyMuPDF get_drawings()) for clean vector plans — exact and traceable when it works, but unreliable at auto-grouping paths into closed room polygons — and fall back to foundation-model few-shot segmentation (SAM + an LLM, e.g. the GMFS approach needing only ~5 labeled examples) for raster/scanned plans, rather than training a custom segmentation network (which needs hundreds-to-thousands of annotated plans, e.g. CubiCasa5K's 5,000 expert-polygon-annotated plans) or a geometry VLM (FloorplanVLM required a 2M-pair dataset and 32x H200 GPUs and was trained on residential, not commercial, plans). Custom instance segmentation (YOLOv8-seg/Mask R-CNN) tops out around ~90% detection mAP — fine for detection, far short of 2-5% area precision. For a small, cost-conscious subcontractor, the most defensible recommendation is to seriously evaluate BUY options: Beam AI/iBeam (DIY AI-only ~$16K/yr; human-reviewed "Done For You" bid-ready in 24-72h) and Togal.AI (independent-ish study found within 5% of On-Screen Takeoff, but only after manual adjustments) before committing to a build. Across both build and buy, penny-precise bid output realistically still requires an estimator's confirmation step.

## Findings (with confidence + sources)

### [high] No fully-automated approach reaches bid-grade (2-5%) area accuracy without human correction; even vendors treat human review as necessary for bid-ready output.
Beam AI sells a 'Done For You (AI + Human in the loop)' tier delivering 'bid-ready, human-reviewed takeoffs and estimates in 24-72 hours' — the vendor labels the human-reviewed tier (not the AI-only tier) as bid-ready. An independent-leaning academic study (March 2025) found Togal.AI stayed within a 5% margin vs On-Screen Takeoff for most quantity classifications, but the primary text shows this was achieved 'with manual adjustments.' Research-grade segmentation also notes SAM masks 'split objects between two masks' and 'are not rectangular,' i.e., not penny-precise. Convergent conclusion: bid-grade output requires a human confirmation step regardless of build-vs-buy.

### [high] Direct vector/CAD PDF parsing (PyMuPDF get_drawings()) gives exact, traceable geometry for clean vector plans, but reliably grouping extracted paths into closed room polygons is not determinable from the extracted data alone.
page.get_drawings() returns vector graphics as a list of path dicts with draw-command tuples for lines ('l'), rectangles ('re'), quads ('qu'), and Bezier curves ('c'), plus bounding rect and rendering order (seqno) — enabling exact, traceable measurement. But the same primary source states it 'may still be unclear (and programmatically impossible to determine) which paths belong together and actually are part of a larger figure.' Corroborated by US Patent US11392736B2 (room borders 'may be inferred by a human viewer' but 'a computer may not have these capabilities' without added heuristics: polygon offsetting 50-100mm to close gaps, Boolean merges, layer filtering) and CAD-to-boundary sources noting failures on incomplete walls/overlapping elements. Mitigations exist (cluster_drawings(), extended hierarchy) but auto-grouping remains a documented, significant limitation. Best for clean vector PDFs; degrades on messy/scanned input.

### [high] Foundation-model few-shot segmentation (SAM + an LLM, e.g. GMFS) can segment rooms/doors in raster floor plans with only ~5 labeled examples — drastically less labeled data than custom-trained segmentation models.
GMFS (GPT-integrated Multi-object Few-shot SAM), published Dec 2024 in Elsevier's Developments in the Built Environment, combines SAM (masks via similarity maps + cluster-based point-sampling prompts) with GPT-4 (mask classification) to segment rooms and doors in 2D raster floor plans 'using only five reference samples,' explicitly addressing the limitation that conventional deep learning 'often require[s] extensive annotated datasets.' This is the most promising raster/scanned-PDF fallback path: near-zero labeling cost, no custom segmentation network to train. Caveat: 'usable' here means segmentation/accessibility-analysis quality (mIoU ~82), NOT penny-precise area; masks can be non-rectangular and split objects, so it still feeds a human-correction step rather than producing bid-grade area directly.

### [high] Training a custom specialized floor-plan recognition model realistically needs thousands of expert-annotated plans (order of magnitude).
CubiCasa5K, the field's flagship dataset, contains 5,000 floor plans manually annotated by trained humans as polygons (per-image SVG) across over 80 object categories, selected and reviewed from ~15,000 mostly Finnish images, with a 2-stage QA protocol; single-image annotation took 5-120 minutes. It was 'over five times larger' than the previously largest dataset (Liu et al. 2017, ~815-870 images). This sets the labeled-data order of magnitude for custom floor-plan models at thousands of annotated plans — a large effort. Caveat: CubiCasa is residential Finnish real-estate plans, so a commercial-construction takeoff tool would likely need its own domain-specific labeled data; transfer learning could reduce the count below 5K but not to the single-digit level of few-shot foundation-model approaches.

### [high] Custom instance segmentation (YOLOv8-seg / Mask R-CNN) trained on ~1,500 images reaches ~90%+ detection mAP, but detection mAP is not area precision and falls short of 2-5% bid-grade area error.
On ~1,500 annotated images, YOLOv8 outperformed Mask R-CNN at instance segmentation: mAP@0.5 0.939 vs 0.902, precision 0.93 vs 0.85, recall 0.97 vs 0.88 (single-class). This indicates a custom YOLOv8-seg can reach ~90%+ detection accuracy. Important hedge: the benchmark is apple-orchard green-fruit segmentation, not floor plans, and detection mAP/precision/recall do not measure square-footage error — so this is a directional inference about the ceiling of custom segmentation, not a floor-plan-specific area-accuracy result. Detection-grade ≠ bid-grade area.

### [high] The VLM-for-geometry route (training a model to output structured floor-plan geometry) is far beyond a small subcontractor's build budget and was demonstrated on residential, not commercial, data.
FloorplanVLM (arXiv 2602.06507, Feb 2026) required a 2-million-pair dataset (Floorplan-2M, drawn from >20M raw vector floorplans) plus a 300K high-fidelity subset, trained on 32x H200 GPUs (SFT + GRPO). The data originated from 'an industrial interior design platform' with residential examples (bedroom, kitchen, 'Manhattan-style apartments', homeowner-name PII) — no commercial building types. Caveat flagged: this is the cost to TRAIN a geometry VLM from scratch, not to consume an API or do a small fine-tune; the directional conclusion (don't train your own geometry VLM) is sound, and the residential data means reported accuracy (92.52% external-wall IoU on its own benchmark) does not directly transfer to commercial flooring takeoff.

### [medium] Commercial buy-not-build options exist and should be evaluated before building: Beam AI/iBeam (~$16K/yr AI-only DIY; human-reviewed DFY) and Togal.AI.
Beam AI (iBeam) lists a '$16K/year — DIY (AI Only)' tier explicitly covering Flooring (plus Electrical, Finishes, Painting), and a vendor blog corroborates mid-tier trade licenses at $16K-$18K; a separate 'Done For You (AI + Human in the loop)' tier delivers bid-ready takeoffs in 24-72h. Togal.AI was found within a 5% margin of On-Screen Takeoff for most classifications (after manual adjustments) in a March 2025 study. Confidence is medium because: pricing is list/'typically falls in' and varies by negotiated bid capacity; the Togal study's 'independence' is weak (Togal's CEO is also CIO of seed-funder Coastal Construction; study hosted on Togal's site); and real-world reviews (r/estimators) report ~60-85% accuracy on complex/scanned plans needing heavy correction. Still, these are concrete options a cost-conscious subcontractor should price against build cost.

### [high] Several SAM-based and segmentation research results target inputs/objectives that do NOT transfer to PDF-based, area-precise takeoff.
FloorSAM applies SAM to top-down density maps derived from 3D LiDAR point clouds (not vector/raster PDFs), so its pipeline does not fit a PDF-takeoff tool lacking 3D scans. A separate raster-segmentation paper (arXiv 2408.01526) targets 3D digital-twin reconstruction (noise reduction for an accurate 3D model) and reports only pixel-level metrics (mean F1 0.86, mean IoU 0.76 on CubiCasa), with no floor-area/square-footage accuracy metric — so its results cannot be claimed as bid-grade for flooring. These scope mismatches mean impressive-sounding SAM/segmentation papers should not be over-weighted for the takeoff use case.

## Turn 2 - Assistant

No — **it’s not impossible.**

But **fully automatic, no-human, bid-grade flooring takeoff is basically not realistic right now**.

The right way to think about it:

> **Impossible / not worth chasing:**
> Upload plans → AI perfectly measures every room → assigns finishes → gives final bid-ready square footage with no estimator review.

> **Very possible:**
> Upload plans → AI finds the right pages, reads schedules, detects rooms/areas, proposes polygons and finishes → estimator quickly reviews/corrects → final square footage is traceable and reliable.

That second version is absolutely buildable.

## The key point

“Auto-takeoff” is really several different problems:

1. **Find the floor plan pages** — very possible.
2. **Read finish schedules, legends, room names, finish codes** — very possible with VLMs/LLMs.
3. **Understand scale** — possible, but needs review.
4. **Detect rooms/areas** — possible, but messy.
5. **Turn walls/lines into clean room polygons** — hard.
6. **Assign the correct flooring finish to each room** — possible, but needs confirmation.
7. **Produce bid-grade square footage** — only trustworthy after human review.

So the answer is not “AI can’t do takeoff.”

The answer is:

> **AI can speed up takeoff a lot, but it should not be trusted as the final estimator by itself.**

## What the research is really saying

The report is basically warning you not to waste months chasing the wrong fantasy.

### 1. Vector PDFs are your best case

Some construction PDFs have real line/vector data inside them. In those cases, code can extract actual lines and shapes from the PDF.

That is powerful because you are not guessing from pixels. You are reading the drawing geometry directly.

But the hard part is this:

> The PDF may contain thousands of lines, but it does not clearly say, “these 14 lines form Room 102.”

A human sees the room. The computer sees disconnected lines, gaps, symbols, doors, text, hatches, dimensions, walls, and random drawing artifacts.

So vector parsing is useful, but not magic.

Best use: **help generate traceable geometry and snap-to-line tools**, not fully automatic final takeoff.

### 2. Scanned/raster plans are harder

If the plan is just an image, now the system has to visually understand the page.

That’s where SAM-style segmentation or VLM-assisted segmentation can help. It may find likely room regions with a few examples.

But that does not mean it will produce perfect square footage. It may split a room, miss a boundary, include wall thickness incorrectly, or create weird mask shapes.

Best use: **suggest polygons/areas for the estimator to accept or fix.**

### 3. Training your own model from scratch is probably a trap

This is the biggest takeaway.

Training a serious custom model would require a lot of labeled plans. Not just plans — plans with expert-corrected polygons, rooms, finishes, and quantities.

That means hundreds or thousands of annotated examples. Maybe eventually, but not first.

For V1, you should not be thinking:

> “Let’s train our own AI model.”

You should be thinking:

> “Let’s build the workflow that captures human corrections so we can train later.”

That is the smarter path.

## What is actually buildable for your app

A strong V1 would not claim “automatic bid-grade takeoff.”

It would claim something more like:

> **AI-assisted flooring takeoff with traceable measurements and estimator approval.**

The workflow should be:

1. User uploads plan PDF.
2. System identifies floor plan pages, schedules, legends, and finish notes.
3. System extracts text and likely room/finish information.
4. User sets or confirms scale.
5. System proposes rooms/areas where possible.
6. Estimator reviews the page visually.
7. Estimator traces, edits, snaps, deletes, or accepts polygons.
8. App calculates SF, base LF, waste, finish totals, and room-level quantities.
9. Everything syncs to the bid sheet.
10. Corrections are stored as future training data.

That is not impossible. That is the product.

## Build vs buy

For an actual flooring subcontractor trying to make money soon, the report is saying:

**You should seriously test Beam/iBeam and Togal before building everything.**

Not because they are perfect, but because they may already solve enough of the problem to avoid spending huge development money.

But building still makes sense if your goal is:

- a flooring-specific workflow,
- better Google Sheets sync,
- better room-by-room traceability,
- better human correction UX,
- a proprietary dataset over time,
- a product you eventually sell to other contractors.

So the question is not “build or buy forever.”

The smarter question is:

> **Can we buy/test first, learn exactly where these tools fail, then build the missing workflow around those failures?**

## What I would not do

I would not start by training YOLO, Mask R-CNN, or a custom segmentation network.

I would not start by buying GPUs.

I would not promise fully automated estimates.

I would not try to beat every commercial vendor on AI accuracy immediately.

That path is expensive and likely disappointing.

## What I would do

I’d build a practical hybrid system:

### V1: Human-in-the-loop takeoff app

Focus on:

- PDF upload
- page classification
- finish schedule extraction
- room/finish table extraction
- scale confirmation
- fast manual polygon tracing
- AI-suggested room outlines where possible
- editable room/finish assignments
- square footage calculations
- Google Sheets sync
- correction history

This alone could be valuable.

### V2: Smarter assisted geometry

Add:

- vector PDF line extraction,
- snap-to-wall,
- auto-detect closed areas,
- suggested room polygons,
- door/opening handling,
- finish-code matching,
- confidence scoring.

### V3: Training/data advantage

Use every correction as labeled data:

- original page image,
- AI suggestion,
- estimator-corrected polygon,
- room name,
- finish code,
- final SF,
- reason for correction.

After enough real jobs, then you can consider custom models.

## The honest feasibility answer

For **100% automatic takeoff**:
**Not impossible in theory, but not realistic for bid-grade commercial flooring right now.**

For **AI-assisted estimator workflow**:
**Very realistic.**

For **saving serious estimator time**:
**Yes, possible.**

For **replacing the estimator completely**:
**No, not yet.**

For **building a product worth selling**:
**Yes, if the product is honest about review/correction and makes that review much faster.**

The winning product is not “AI does the whole takeoff.”

The winning product is:

> **AI gets the estimator 60–80% of the way there, makes every number traceable, and lets them correct the remaining 20–40% faster than Bluebeam/PlanSwift/manual tools.**

## Turn 3 - User

### [high] Training a custom specialized floor-plan recognition model realistically needs thousands of expert-annotated plans (order of magnitude). CubiCasa5K, the field's flagship dataset, contains 5,000 floor plans manually annotated by trained humans as polygons (per-image SVG) across over 80 object categories, selected and reviewed from ~15,000 mostly Finnish images, with a 2-stage QA protocol; single-image annotation took 5-120 minutes. It was 'over five times larger' than the previously largest dataset (Liu et al. 2017, ~815-870 images). This sets the labeled-data order of magnitude for custom floor-plan models at thousands of annotated plans — a large effort. Caveat: CubiCasa is residential Finnish real-estate plans, so a commercial-construction takeoff tool would likely need its own domain-specific labeled data; transfer learning could reduce the count below 5K but not to the single-digit level of few-shot foundation-model approaches. what does this mean and what did it do and I don't understand the vecot pdf thing and lines poygrons or whatever would we not use those in loop with the picture of the page to train it that way to say ok this symbol realtes to this picture of a room or idk

---

## Turn 4 - Assistant

I’ll break this down in plain English and separate the confusing pieces: what CubiCasa was, what vector PDFs are, and how they would fit into your training loop.

Yes — your instinct is right.

You **would** use the picture of the page, the vector PDF lines, the text, the room labels, the finish symbols, and the estimator’s corrected polygons together in a loop.

The confusing part is: **those things do not automatically equal “training data” until a human confirms what they mean.**

## What the CubiCasa thing means

CubiCasa5K was basically a big dataset for teaching AI to understand floor plans.

They had around **5,000 floor plan images**, and trained humans manually marked things like:

- walls
- doors
- windows
- rooms
- room boundaries
- symbols
- object categories
- polygons around spaces

So the AI was not magically learning from random PDFs. It was learning from examples where a human had already said:

> “This area is a room.”
> “These lines are walls.”
> “This polygon is the kitchen.”
> “This symbol is a door.”
> “This boundary belongs together.”

That is what “expert-annotated plans” means.

For your flooring tool, the equivalent would be:

> “This is the actual room polygon.”
> “This room is LVT-1.”
> “This part should be excluded.”
> “This room’s final approved square footage is 842 SF.”
> “This line is a wall boundary.”
> “This text tag belongs to this room.”

The report is saying: to train a custom model from scratch, you probably need **a lot** of examples like that. Not five. More like hundreds at minimum, probably thousands if you want it to generalize well.

But that does **not** mean you need thousands before building the product.

It means you should build the product so that every estimator correction becomes future training data.

## What a vector PDF is

There are two basic types of plan PDFs.

### 1. Raster/scanned PDF

This is basically a picture.

Like someone scanned a paper blueprint. The computer sees pixels:

> black pixel, white pixel, gray pixel, black line, text-looking shape.

It does not naturally know those pixels are walls, doors, rooms, or finish tags.

### 2. Vector PDF

This is more like a digital drawing.

Instead of only pixels, the PDF contains drawing instructions like:

> draw a line from this coordinate to that coordinate
> draw a rectangle here
> draw text here
> draw this hatch pattern
> draw this curve
> draw this symbol

So instead of looking at a picture and guessing where the line is, code can sometimes extract the actual line coordinates.

That is what PyMuPDF `get_drawings()` is about. It can pull out the raw drawing pieces.

## What “lines” and “polygons” mean

A **line** is just one segment.

Example:

> from point A to point B

A **path** is a group of drawing commands.

Example:

> line, line, curve, line, rectangle, etc.

A **polygon** is a closed shape.

Example:

> four walls connected into a room boundary.

For flooring takeoff, the thing you ultimately need is usually a **polygon**, because square footage comes from the area inside that polygon.

So the system needs to go from this:

> thousands of loose lines, text, symbols, hatches, dimensions, doors, wall gaps

to this:

> Room 101 = this closed polygon = 842 SF = finish LVT-1

That conversion is the hard part.

## Why vector lines do not solve everything automatically

A vector PDF may tell you:

> “Here are 18,000 lines on the page.”

But it usually does **not** tell you:

> “These 12 lines form the Sales Office.”
> “This gap is a door opening, but the room boundary should continue across it.”
> “Ignore this furniture line.”
> “This hatch belongs to the floor finish, not the wall detail.”
> “This text label belongs to the room to the left, not the room above.”

Humans infer all that visually.

The computer sees geometry, but not always meaning.

That is why vector parsing is powerful but incomplete.

## Would we use vector lines with the picture to train it?

Yes. That is exactly the smart direction.

Think of each plan page as having multiple layers of information:

```text
Rendered page image:
What the estimator sees visually.

Vector lines:
Actual CAD/PDF geometry when available.

Text extraction:
Room names, room numbers, finish codes, dimensions, notes.

Symbols/hatches:
Patterns that may indicate flooring type or area type.

Estimator correction:
The final true polygon and finish assignment.
```

The model should eventually learn from all of that together.

But the key is: **the human-corrected result is the truth.**

The vector lines are useful hints. The page image is useful context. The text is useful context. But the final training label is the estimator-approved takeoff.

## Example

Imagine the plan has this room:

```text
Room 104
Group Fitness
Finish: RF-2
```

The PDF might contain:

- visible room outline on the rendered image,
- vector wall lines,
- a door swing,
- text saying “104 GROUP FITNESS,”
- finish schedule saying “RF-2 = 8mm rubber flooring,”
- maybe a hatch pattern for rubber.

Your system could propose:

> “I think this polygon is Room 104. I think finish is RF-2. I estimate 2,940 SF.”

Then the estimator checks it and says:

> “Close, but you included the storage closet. Correct SF is 2,810.”

Now you store:

```text
Original page image
Vector lines
Extracted text
AI-proposed polygon
Estimator-corrected polygon
Final room name
Final finish
Final square footage
```

That is extremely valuable training data.

Over time, your system learns from the corrections.

## So what should the system learn?

Not just “this symbol relates to this picture of a room.”

It should learn several relationships:

### 1. Room boundary understanding

> Which walls/lines form the usable floor area?

### 2. Text-to-room matching

> Which room name, number, or finish code belongs to which polygon?

### 3. Finish schedule matching

> RF-2 means rubber flooring, CPT-1 means carpet tile, LVT-1 means luxury vinyl tile, etc.

### 4. Exclusions

> Do not include casework, shafts, stairs, mechanical spaces, columns, wall thickness, or areas outside scope.

### 5. Human correction patterns

> When estimators fix this kind of AI mistake, what did they usually change?

That is the real data loop.

## Why not just train on vector PDFs automatically?

Because vector data can lie or confuse you.

For example:

- walls may not be closed,
- door openings create gaps,
- furniture lines look like boundaries,
- dimensions and callouts add extra lines,
- hatches add tons of useless lines,
- layers may be missing,
- exported PDFs may flatten everything,
- scanned PDFs have no vectors at all,
- different architects draw differently.

So vector extraction is not enough by itself.

But it is still very useful.

The right answer is:

> Use vector lines when available, use image understanding when needed, and always use human approval as the final truth.

## The product architecture should be hybrid

This is probably the best mental model:

```text
PDF upload
   ↓
Render each page as an image
   ↓
Extract text from PDF
   ↓
Extract vector lines if available
   ↓
AI identifies plan pages, schedules, legends, finish tags
   ↓
System proposes room polygons / flooring areas
   ↓
Estimator accepts, edits, or redraws
   ↓
Final SF is calculated from approved polygons
   ↓
Corrections become training data
```

That is the loop.

## Where training fits in

At first, you do **not** need to train your own big model.

At first, you use:

- PDF parsing,
- vector extraction,
- OCR/text extraction,
- VLM/LLM calls,
- maybe SAM-style segmentation,
- good UI for correction,
- estimator-approved data storage.

Then later, after you have enough corrected jobs, you train smaller custom models for specific tasks.

For example:

```text
Model 1: classify page type
Floor plan / finish schedule / legend / detail / spec page

Model 2: detect room labels and finish codes

Model 3: suggest room polygons

Model 4: match finish schedule items to room areas

Model 5: predict likely corrections based on past estimator behavior
```

You do not start with “train one giant AI that does everything.”

You start with a workflow that creates the dataset.

## The simple answer

CubiCasa means:

> Serious floor-plan AI needs lots of human-labeled examples.

Vector PDF means:

> Some PDFs contain real drawing geometry, not just pixels.

Lines/polygons means:

> Lines are drawing pieces; polygons are closed room/floor areas used to calculate square footage.

And your idea is correct:

> Yes, you would combine the page image, vector lines, extracted text, symbols, and human-corrected polygons to train the system over time.

The best version is not:

> “AI looks at a picture and guesses everything.”

The best version is:

> “AI sees the page like an estimator, reads the PDF geometry when available, reads the text/schedules, proposes the takeoff, and learns from every correction.”

## Turn 5 - User

So the system needs to go from this:

thousands of loose lines, text, symbols, hatches, dimensions, doors, wall gaps

to this:

Room 101 = this closed polygon = 842 SF = finish LVT-1

That conversion is the hard par what goes into that  then for this “Here are 18,000 lines on the page.”

But it usually does not tell you:

“These 12 lines form the Sales Office.”
“This gap is a door opening, but the room boundary should continue across it.”
“Ignore this furniture line.”
“This hatch belongs to the floor finish, not the wall detail.”
“This text label belongs to the room to the left, not the room above.” can you not use Claude code codex in house tools to like view the PDF normally as image then view the vector stuff to pick up on it and save patterns I feel like probably not what I just said but different way to go about this then in the past bc of ai coding tools  ok how does it over time get better at this Now you store:

Original page image
Vector lines
Extracted text
AI-proposed polygon
Estimator-corrected polygon
Final room name
Final finish
Final square footage

That is extremely valuable training data.

Over time, your system learns from the corrections. like you just expect me to magically do that and figure out myself you have to be very specific technical on that part if you don't know just I don't know

## Turn 6 - Assistant

You’re right to push on that. “Store corrections and it learns” is too hand-wavy unless we define exactly what gets stored, what code runs, what model changes, and when it improves.

The missing piece is: there are **two different “AI” roles** here. Claude/Codex can help you **build the pipeline**, but your product still needs its own stored examples, evaluation set, and model/heuristic updates. The app does not improve just because Claude looked at a PDF once.

You’re asking the right question. The real system is not:

> “Throw the PDF into Claude and hope it learns.”

The real system is:

> **Build a geometry engine + AI assistant + correction UI + dataset pipeline + evaluation loop.**

Claude Code / Codex can help you **build** that system. They do not magically become the production model unless you wire the product that way. Codex and Claude Code are coding agents that can read/edit/run code and help build features, fix bugs, and work across a codebase; they are development tools, not a substitute for your own takeoff data pipeline. citeturn360533search6turn360533search1

## First: what goes into “18,000 lines → Room 101 polygon”

Think of the PDF as having messy raw ingredients.

The system has to create **candidate rooms** from those ingredients, score them, and let the estimator approve/correct them.

Here is the technical pipeline.

```text
PDF page
  ↓
Rendered page image
  ↓
Extract text blocks
  ↓
Extract vector drawing paths if available
  ↓
Normalize all coordinates into the same page coordinate system
  ↓
Classify drawing elements
  ↓
Build a wall/line graph
  ↓
Snap small gaps
  ↓
Generate candidate closed polygons
  ↓
Match room labels + finish codes to polygons
  ↓
Score confidence
  ↓
Estimator approves/edits
  ↓
Final approved polygon becomes training data
```

PyMuPDF’s `get_drawings()` can extract PDF drawing commands as path dictionaries, including lines, rectangles, curves, colors, widths, and dashing. That gives you raw geometry, but it still does not tell you the semantic meaning of every line. citeturn107398search0turn107398search17

## Step-by-step: how the system turns lines into rooms

### Step 1: Render the page as an image

Even if the PDF has vector data, you still render the page into a normal image.

Why?

Because that image is what the human estimator sees. It is also what a vision model sees.

You store something like:

```json
{
  "page_id": "page_12",
  "image_path": "s3://plans/project123/page_12_300dpi.png",
  "width_px": 3300,
  "height_px": 2550,
  "dpi": 300
}
```

### Step 2: Extract vector drawings

For vector PDFs, you extract raw drawing objects:

```json
{
  "vector_entity_id": "line_987",
  "page_id": "page_12",
  "type": "line",
  "x1": 144.2,
  "y1": 322.8,
  "x2": 418.9,
  "y2": 322.8,
  "stroke_width": 0.5,
  "color": "#000000",
  "dash_pattern": null
}
```

But this line might be:

- a wall,
- a furniture edge,
- a dimension line,
- a hatch line,
- a door swing,
- a leader/callout,
- a title block line,
- a random detail.

So the first model/heuristic is not “find rooms.”

It is:

> **Classify each vector element.**

Possible classes:

```text
wall_candidate
door_candidate
room_boundary_candidate
hatch
dimension
furniture
symbol
gridline
text_underline
unknown
```

### Step 3: Extract text blocks

You also extract text and coordinates:

```json
{
  "text_block_id": "txt_441",
  "page_id": "page_12",
  "text": "ROOM 101 SALES OFFICE",
  "bbox": [510, 830, 760, 865]
}
```

Another:

```json
{
  "text_block_id": "txt_442",
  "page_id": "page_12",
  "text": "LVT-1",
  "bbox": [540, 870, 610, 895]
}
```

This matters because rooms are not just shapes. You need:

```text
shape + room name + finish + square footage
```

### Step 4: Normalize coordinates

This part is boring but critical.

The PDF has coordinates in PDF points. The rendered image has pixels. Your database might store polygons in normalized 0–1 coordinates. You need a transform so everything lines up.

Example:

```text
PDF point coordinate → image pixel coordinate → real-world inches/feet
```

You need this because the estimator edits a polygon on the image, but the final square footage needs to be calculated in real-world units.

### Step 5: Remove obvious junk

Before trying to create rooms, filter out garbage.

Examples:

- ignore title block regions,
- ignore very tiny lines,
- ignore repeated hatch lines,
- ignore dashed dimension lines,
- ignore symbols that are not boundaries,
- ignore furniture blocks if identifiable,
- ignore text boxes.

This can start as rules.

Example:

```text
If line is very thin, dashed, and has arrowheads nearby → probably dimension.
If many parallel repeated lines are close together → probably hatch.
If line is inside a known furniture symbol → ignore for room boundary.
If line is near title block area → ignore.
```

Later, this becomes a trained classifier.

### Step 6: Build a graph

This is the important geometry part.

You turn lines into a graph:

```text
line endpoints = nodes
line segments = edges
```

Example:

```text
A ───── B
│       │
│       │
D ───── C
```

If the lines connect, they can form a closed shape.

But architectural plans have gaps:

```text
A ───── B
│       │
│       gap for door
D ───── C
```

So the system has to “snap” or “bridge” certain gaps.

### Step 7: Snap small gaps

This is where your example comes in:

> “This gap is a door opening, but the room boundary should continue across it.”

The system needs rules like:

```text
If two wall endpoints face each other,
and the gap is between 2 ft and 5 ft,
and a door swing arc or door symbol is nearby,
then create a virtual boundary edge across the opening.
```

You do **not** want to permanently change the PDF geometry.

You create an inferred edge:

```json
{
  "edge_type": "virtual_boundary",
  "reason": "door_gap_bridge",
  "confidence": 0.78
}
```

So the estimator can see:

> “The system bridged this door gap because it thinks this is still the room boundary.”

### Step 8: Generate candidate polygons

Once you have cleaned lines and virtual edges, you run polygon generation.

A geometry library can attempt to find closed shapes. PostGIS can store and calculate polygon areas, and its `ST_Area` function returns the area of polygon/multipolygon geometries in the geometry’s units. citeturn107398search15

So the output might be:

```json
{
  "candidate_polygon_id": "poly_221",
  "page_id": "page_12",
  "points": [[500, 820], [900, 820], [900, 1130], [500, 1130]],
  "area_px": 124000,
  "confidence": 0.72
}
```

This polygon is not final. It is a suggestion.

### Step 9: Match text to polygon

Now the system asks:

> Which text labels belong to this polygon?

Rules:

```text
If text is inside polygon → likely belongs to polygon.
If text is near polygon center → likely belongs to polygon.
If room number/name is inside polygon but finish code is nearby → attach both.
If finish code appears in room finish schedule → use schedule mapping.
```

Example output:

```json
{
  "candidate_polygon_id": "poly_221",
  "room_number": "101",
  "room_name": "SALES OFFICE",
  "finish_code": "LVT-1",
  "finish_system": "Luxury Vinyl Tile",
  "label_confidence": 0.88
}
```

### Step 10: Score confidence

The system should not just say “done.”

It should say:

```text
Room polygon confidence: 72%
Room label confidence: 88%
Finish assignment confidence: 91%
Scale confidence: 95%
Needs review: yes
```

Low confidence items get shown first to the estimator.

## Can Claude/Codex look at the image and vector stuff together?

Yes, but with a big caveat.

A better way to say it:

> Claude/Codex can help you build a tool that shows the rendered page, overlays extracted vector lines, runs geometry algorithms, calls vision/LLM models, and saves estimator corrections.

But you probably would **not** want Claude Code or Codex themselves to be the live production takeoff engine. They are better as development agents. Your production engine would be code you own:

```text
Next.js app
Python PDF/geometry service
Database
Object storage
VLM/LLM API
Optional segmentation model
Estimator review UI
Training/evaluation pipeline
```

You can use Claude/Codex to write and improve that code. But the system’s learning comes from your stored takeoff examples and model updates, not from one-off chats.

## How it actually gets better over time

There are four levels of “getting better.” This is the part that matters.

### Level 1: Better prompts and rules

At first, no training.

You store every failure and manually improve rules.

Example failure:

```text
System keeps treating diagonal hatch lines as room boundaries.
```

Fix:

```text
Add hatch detector:
- repeated parallel thin lines
- same angle
- evenly spaced
- inside larger region
→ classify as hatch and exclude from room boundary graph.
```

This is not machine learning yet. It is product learning.

### Level 2: Few-shot examples for the LLM/VLM

You create examples from real corrected jobs.

Example:

```text
Before:
Image crop + vector overlay + text blocks

Human correction:
This label belongs to the room below, not the room above.
```

Then future API calls include similar examples:

```text
When a finish tag is between two rooms, prefer the room whose boundary contains most of the tag bbox.
If the tag is outside both polygons, use nearest centroid only after checking leader lines.
```

This improves behavior without training your own model.

### Level 3: Train small classifiers

This is where it becomes real ML, but still manageable.

You do **not** start by training “full auto-takeoff AI.”

You train small models like:

#### Model A: vector element classifier

Input:

```text
line geometry
line width
dash pattern
color
length
angle
nearby text
nearby arcs
nearby repeated lines
image crop around line
```

Output:

```text
wall / door / hatch / dimension / furniture / unknown
```

Training label comes from corrections.

Example:

```json
{
  "features": {
    "length_px": 412,
    "angle_deg": 90,
    "stroke_width": 0.5,
    "dash": false,
    "near_text": false,
    "parallel_repetition_score": 0.02
  },
  "image_crop": "s3://...",
  "label": "wall"
}
```

#### Model B: room-label-to-polygon matcher

Input:

```text
text block
candidate polygons around it
distance to each polygon center
whether text is inside polygon
leader lines
room number pattern
finish code pattern
```

Output:

```text
text block belongs to polygon X
```

#### Model C: polygon quality scorer

Input:

```text
candidate polygon
nearby wall edges
door gaps
area
shape complexity
text inside
SAM mask overlap
human edit history
```

Output:

```text
probability this candidate polygon is acceptable
```

This is the model that learns:

> “These kinds of shapes usually get accepted.”
> “These kinds of shapes usually get edited.”
> “These kinds of shapes are probably wrong.”

### Level 4: Train/fine-tune segmentation

Later, when you have enough approved room polygons, you export training data.

For each approved room, you create:

```text
page image
binary mask of approved polygon
class: room_floor_area
metadata: finish type, room name, page scale
```

The common segmentation dataset structure is similar to COCO-style annotations, which are widely used for object detection and instance segmentation; COCO-style datasets include segmentation masks/polygons and bounding boxes. citeturn107398search3turn107398search4

So your exported training row becomes:

```json
{
  "image": "page_12.png",
  "annotations": [
    {
      "category": "floor_area",
      "segmentation": [[500,820, 900,820, 900,1130, 500,1130]],
      "bbox": [500,820,400,310],
      "area": 124000,
      "room_name": "SALES OFFICE",
      "finish_code": "LVT-1"
    }
  ]
}
```

Now you can train a segmentation model to suggest room/floor-area masks.

But again: this happens **after** you have corrected examples.

## The exact database pieces you need

Here is the non-magical version.

You need tables like this.

```text
projects
- id
- name
- client
- created_at

plan_pages
- id
- project_id
- pdf_page_number
- image_url
- width_px
- height_px
- scale_ratio
- scale_confirmed_by_user

text_blocks
- id
- page_id
- text
- bbox_px
- source
- confidence

vector_entities
- id
- page_id
- type
- geometry_json
- stroke_width
- color
- dash_pattern
- extracted_layer_guess
- classifier_label
- classifier_confidence

candidate_polygons
- id
- page_id
- source
- geometry_px
- area_px
- inferred_edges_json
- confidence
- generated_by_model_version

approved_polygons
- id
- candidate_polygon_id
- page_id
- room_name
- room_number
- finish_code
- geometry_px
- area_sf
- approved_by_user_id
- approved_at

polygon_edit_events
- id
- candidate_polygon_id
- approved_polygon_id
- edit_type
- before_geometry_px
- after_geometry_px
- reason_optional
- user_id
- created_at

model_versions
- id
- model_type
- version
- training_dataset_id
- metrics_json
- deployed_at

training_examples
- id
- page_id
- input_image_url
- input_vector_json_url
- input_text_json_url
- label_polygon_json
- label_room_name
- label_finish_code
- source_approved_polygon_id
```

Without these tables, “it learns over time” is mostly BS.

With these tables, it is real.

## What the correction UI needs to capture

The estimator should not just draw a final polygon. You want to capture **how** they corrected the AI.

Example buttons/actions:

```text
Accept polygon
Move vertex
Add vertex
Delete vertex
Split polygon
Merge polygons
Exclude area
Bridge door gap
Remove wrong hatch boundary
Assign room label
Change finish code
Mark as not in scope
```

Why?

Because the edit action teaches you the failure mode.

Example:

```json
{
  "edit_type": "remove_wrong_boundary",
  "reason": "hatch_detected_as_wall",
  "before_area_sf": 916,
  "after_area_sf": 842
}
```

Now you know the model did not just have a random error. It confused hatch lines for walls.

That tells you exactly what to improve.

## What “training” looks like every month

This is the practical loop.

```text
Week 1-4:
Use rules + VLM + manual correction.
Store everything.

End of month:
Pull all approved polygons and corrections.
Create evaluation set: 20-50 pages held out.
Train small classifier or improve rules.
Run old system vs new system on same eval set.
Compare:
- polygon IoU
- area error %
- finish assignment accuracy
- estimator correction time
- accept-without-edit rate
Deploy only if better.
```

The most important metrics are not fancy AI metrics.

For flooring, track:

```text
Area error before correction
Area error after correction
% polygons accepted without edit
Average seconds to correct a room
Finish assignment accuracy
Rooms missed
False rooms created
Estimator trust score
```

If the old system required 7 minutes per room and the new one requires 3 minutes, you improved.

## What you build first

Do **not** start with a giant training system.

Start with this:

### V1 technical build

```text
1. PDF upload
2. Render pages to images
3. Extract text
4. Extract vector drawings
5. Show page image in takeoff UI
6. Overlay vector lines
7. Let user toggle:
   - all vector lines
   - likely walls
   - likely hatches
   - likely dimensions
   - text blocks
8. Let user draw/edit polygons
9. Calculate SF from approved polygon + scale
10. Assign room name + finish
11. Save final approved polygon
12. Export/sync to Google Sheet
```

That alone creates the dataset.

### V2 technical build

```text
1. Auto-classify vector lines
2. Auto-generate candidate closed polygons
3. Auto-match text labels to polygons
4. Auto-suggest finish codes
5. Add confidence scoring
6. Track correction types
```

### V3 technical build

```text
1. Export approved polygons to COCO-style segmentation data
2. Train small classifier for wall/hatch/dimension/furniture lines
3. Train room-label matcher
4. Train polygon quality scorer
5. Use active learning to show uncertain examples first
```

Label Studio is an example of the type of labeling workflow you could borrow from: it supports model predictions as pre-labels and continuous active learning, which is basically the same concept you want inside your estimator review tool. citeturn107398search20

## The important distinction

You asked:

> Can we not use Claude/Codex to view the PDF normally as image, then view vector stuff, pick up on it, and save patterns?

Yes, but split it into two parts.

### During development

Claude Code/Codex can help build:

```text
- PyMuPDF extraction scripts
- vector overlay UI
- polygon editing tools
- database schema
- training export jobs
- evaluation scripts
- model training scripts
```

### During production

Your app does the work:

```text
- Python service extracts page image/vector/text
- geometry engine creates candidate polygons
- VLM/LLM helps classify and explain
- estimator corrects
- database stores labels
- scheduled training/eval job improves models
```

## A concrete example of improvement

### Job 1

System sees this:

```text
Parallel diagonal hatch lines inside a room.
```

It incorrectly creates 12 tiny polygons.

Estimator deletes them and draws one correct room.

Stored correction:

```text
Mistake: hatch lines treated as boundaries
Fix: ignore repeated parallel thin lines inside larger boundary
```

### Job 10

System sees similar hatch pattern.

Rule catches it.

It creates 1 room instead of 12.

Estimator correction time drops.

### Job 50

You have enough examples to train a hatch-vs-wall classifier.

Now the system learns more patterns than your hand-written rule.

### Job 200

You have enough approved room polygons to train a room-area segmentation model.

Now it starts proposing better polygons even when vector data is messy.

That is how it gets better.

Not magic. Corrections become structured labels. Labels become rules, classifiers, prompts, eval sets, and eventually trained models.

## The best mental model

The goal is not one giant brain.

The goal is a pipeline:

```text
PDF parser:
What raw data exists?

Geometry engine:
What closed shapes might be rooms?

Vision model:
What does the page look like?

Language model:
What text/finish/schedule meaning is present?

Estimator UI:
What is actually correct?

Training pipeline:
What did the estimator fix?

Evaluation:
Did the new version reduce correction time and area error?
```

That is the specific answer.

You are not supposed to “magically figure it out.” The core product is the **correction loop**. The training data does not come from plans alone. It comes from:

> **plans + AI guesses + human-approved corrections + measured error.**

---

## Turn 8 - Assistant

You’re not wrong — I was jumping too far ahead. Let me make it concrete.

No, I would **not** start with GPUs.
No, I would **not** start by training a huge model.
Yes, I would use Claude Code / Codex to build scripts that extract the PDF image, text, vector lines, overlays, and correction storage.

The “learning” starts as **saved structured mistakes + rules + small classifiers**, not some giant AI brain.

## 1. Are vector extraction and text extraction separate?

Yes. They are separate extractions from the **same PDF page**.

They are not separate projects. They both belong to the same `plan_page`.

Think of one page like this:

```text
plan_pages
  page_12
    image: rendered picture of the page
    text_blocks: all extracted text on that page
    vector_entities: all extracted lines/shapes on that page
    candidate_polygons: AI/geometry guesses for rooms
    approved_polygons: estimator-corrected room areas
```

So this:

```text
text_blocks
- id
- page_id
- text
- bbox_px
```

and this:

```text
vector_entities
- id
- page_id
- geometry_json
```

are separate tables, but they connect through:

```text
page_id
```

Then later you match them spatially.

Example:

```text
Text block:
"LVT-1"
bbox: x=500, y=700, width=80, height=30

Candidate polygon:
Room 101 polygon around x=400-900, y=600-1000
```

The system checks:

> Is the text inside this polygon?
> Is it near the polygon center?
> Is there a leader line pointing to this polygon?
> Is “LVT-1” found in the finish schedule?

So text extraction and vector extraction are separate **inputs**, then your app tries to connect them.

## 2. What does `source_approved_polygon_id` mean?

This field:

```text
training_examples
- source_approved_polygon_id
```

just means:

> “This training example came from this human-approved polygon.”

Example:

```text
approved_polygons
id: approved_poly_777
room_name: Sales Office
finish_code: LVT-1
area_sf: 842
geometry_px: final corrected polygon
```

Then your training example says:

```text
training_examples
id: train_ex_1201
source_approved_polygon_id: approved_poly_777
input_image_url: page image
input_vector_json_url: vector lines
input_text_json_url: text blocks
label_polygon_json: final approved polygon
label_room_name: Sales Office
label_finish_code: LVT-1
```

That lets you trace every training label back to the actual estimator-approved takeoff.

## 3. How to get started without human verification yet

You can do a lot before human verification, but you need to treat it as **pre-labeling**, not truth.

Your first goal is not:

> “Train the AI.”

Your first goal is:

> **Build the extraction + overlay + candidate-generation pipeline.**

That means Claude Code / Codex should help you build these scripts first.

## Phase 0: local prototype scripts

Do this before the full web app.

### Script 1: render PDF pages to images

Input:

```text
plans.pdf
```

Output:

```text
/page_images/page_001.png
/page_images/page_002.png
...
```

Purpose:

> This gives you the normal visual page that the estimator sees.

### Script 2: extract text blocks

Output:

```json
[
  {
    "page": 1,
    "text": "SALES OFFICE",
    "bbox": [512, 804, 710, 840]
  },
  {
    "page": 1,
    "text": "LVT-1",
    "bbox": [530, 850, 600, 875]
  }
]
```

Purpose:

> Find room names, room numbers, finish codes, dimensions, schedules, notes.

### Script 3: extract vector drawings

PyMuPDF can extract vector drawing commands from a page using `page.get_drawings()`, returning drawing/path dictionaries rather than only pixels. That is useful because vector plans can contain actual line/shape coordinates, not just a flat image. citeturn772481search0turn772481search4

Output:

```json
[
  {
    "type": "line",
    "x1": 100,
    "y1": 200,
    "x2": 900,
    "y2": 200,
    "stroke_width": 0.5,
    "color": "black"
  }
]
```

Purpose:

> Get the raw linework that may represent walls, room borders, hatches, dimensions, furniture, etc.

### Script 4: create debug overlay images

This is huge.

Take the rendered page image and draw the extracted stuff on top:

```text
blue = extracted text boxes
red = vector lines
green = possible room polygons
yellow = ignored hatch/dimension candidates
```

Output:

```text
/debug/page_001_overlay.png
```

This lets you visually inspect:

> Did we extract the right linework?
> Are the coordinates aligned?
> Are we seeing too much junk?
> Does the PDF even have useful vector data?

This should be one of the first things Claude Code/Codex builds.

## 4. What “auto do V2” really means

You asked:

> How to auto do this: classify vector lines, generate candidate polygons, match text labels, suggest finishes, score confidence, track corrections?

Here’s the actual technical process.

## V1 → V2 technical progression

### V1 is manual with extraction

V1 does not need to be smart. It needs to capture data correctly.

V1:

```text
PDF upload
render page image
extract text
extract vector lines
overlay them
user draws/edits polygon
user assigns room/finish
save approved polygon
```

That gives you your first real labels.

### V2 adds auto-suggestions

V2 uses rules first.

Not GPUs. Not deep learning.

#### 1. Auto-classify vector lines

Start with rule-based labels:

```text
Long solid thick line → possible wall
Dashed thin line → possible dimension
Many repeated parallel thin lines → hatch
Curved arc near wall gap → possible door
Tiny repeated object → possible furniture/symbol
Text-like box or underline → ignore
```

Save this on each vector entity:

```text
classifier_label: likely_wall
classifier_confidence: 0.74
```

#### 2. Auto-generate candidate polygons

Use only `likely_wall` / `likely_boundary` lines.

Process:

```text
take likely wall lines
snap endpoints that are close
bridge likely door gaps
polygonize closed loops
remove tiny polygons
remove weird skinny polygons
score remaining polygons
```

A geometry library can calculate polygon area after you have a scale. PostGIS, for example, has polygon area functions such as `ST_Area`, but you can also calculate this in Python or JavaScript depending on your stack. citeturn772481search3

#### 3. Auto-match text labels to polygons

Rules:

```text
If room label text is inside polygon → attach it.
If finish code is inside polygon → attach it.
If label is between two polygons → choose closest centroid unless leader line suggests otherwise.
If finish code appears in schedule → map code to material.
```

Example:

```text
Polygon 221 contains:
"101"
"SALES OFFICE"
"LVT-1"

Suggestion:
Room 101 — Sales Office — LVT-1
```

#### 4. Auto-suggest finish codes

Use the finish schedule.

Example schedule extraction:

```text
LVT-1 = Luxury Vinyl Tile
RF-2 = 8mm Rubber Flooring
CPT-1 = Carpet Tile
```

Then when a room has `LVT-1`, attach:

```text
finish_code: LVT-1
finish_system: Luxury Vinyl Tile
```

#### 5. Confidence scoring

Confidence can start rule-based.

Example:

```text
+0.25 polygon is closed
+0.20 room text is inside polygon
+0.20 finish code is inside polygon
+0.10 area is realistic
+0.10 polygon has mostly wall-like boundaries
-0.20 polygon contains lots of hatch lines
-0.30 polygon overlaps another room
```

Output:

```text
Room 101 candidate confidence: 82%
```

#### 6. Track correction types

This is where the “learning” starts.

When user edits a polygon, do not just save final shape.

Save what happened:

```text
edit_type: removed_wrong_boundary
reason: hatch_detected_as_wall
before_area_sf: 916
after_area_sf: 842
```

Yes — Claude/Codex should help you design this structure and make the UI record it correctly.

## 5. How does the system learn by job 50?

Here is the non-magical version.

### Job 1–10: mostly rules

You run your rule system.

It makes mistakes.

Estimator corrects them.

You store:

```text
wrong candidate polygon
corrected polygon
edit type
before/after area
which vector lines were used in wrong polygon
which vector lines are on the final approved boundary
```

### Nightly or weekly job

You run a script that creates training rows.

For every vector line on a corrected page, ask:

```text
Was this line part of the final approved room boundary?
Was it inside the room but not part of boundary?
Was it a hatch?
Was it a dimension?
Was it removed by the estimator?
Was it near a door gap?
```

Now each vector line can become a training example.

Example:

```json
{
  "line_id": "line_991",
  "features": {
    "length": 420,
    "angle": 90,
    "stroke_width": 0.5,
    "is_dashed": false,
    "near_text": false,
    "parallel_repetition_score": 0.02,
    "touches_approved_polygon_boundary": true
  },
  "label": "wall_boundary"
}
```

Another:

```json
{
  "line_id": "line_1772",
  "features": {
    "length": 180,
    "angle": 45,
    "stroke_width": 0.2,
    "is_dashed": false,
    "parallel_repetition_score": 0.94,
    "inside_approved_polygon": true
  },
  "label": "hatch"
}
```

### Job 30–50: train small classifier

Now you train a small model:

```text
Input: vector line features
Output: wall / hatch / dimension / furniture / door / unknown
```

This can be a normal CPU model.

For example:

- Random Forest
- XGBoost / LightGBM
- Logistic regression
- small neural net if needed

A Random Forest is a normal supervised classifier that combines many decision trees to improve predictive accuracy and reduce overfitting; it does not require a GPU. citeturn772481search3

This is what “job 50” means:

> You have enough corrected pages to train a better line classifier than your first hand-written rules.

Not a giant takeoff model. A small helper model.

### Then you compare old vs new

You take 20–50 pages the model did **not** train on.

Run:

```text
old rules
new classifier
```

Compare:

```text
Did it identify walls better?
Did it reduce hatch mistakes?
Did candidate polygons improve?
Did estimator correction time drop?
```

If yes, deploy.

If no, keep rules.

## 6. Do you need GPUs?

At first: **no.**

For a long time: probably **mostly no.**

Use GPUs only when you train image segmentation or run heavy vision models yourself.

## Practical GPU answer

### V1

```text
Need GPU? No.
Use:
- PyMuPDF
- OCR/text extraction
- vector extraction
- Postgres/PostGIS or geometry libraries
- web canvas polygon editor
```

### V2

```text
Need GPU? No, mostly.
Use:
- rules
- CPU classifiers
- LLM/VLM API calls if needed
- geometry algorithms
```

### V3

```text
Need GPU? Maybe.
Use GPU if training:
- segmentation model for room masks
- object detection model for doors/symbols
- vision model fine-tune
```

But even V3 does not mean “buy GPUs.” You can use cloud GPU for training runs.

## 7. How many models would you actually have?

I would not use one giant model.

I would use a pipeline of smaller pieces.

Here is the practical set.

## Model / component 1: page classifier

Purpose:

```text
Is this page a floor plan, finish schedule, legend, detail, elevation, spec page, etc.?
```

Start with:

```text
LLM/VLM + rules
```

Training data needed:

```text
50–200 labeled pages is enough to start.
```

GPU:

```text
No.
```

Candidate model:

```text
LLM API first.
Later small text/image classifier.
```

## Model / component 2: text/finish extractor

Purpose:

```text
Extract room names, room numbers, finish codes, schedules.
```

Start with:

```text
PDF text extraction + LLM structured extraction.
```

Training data needed:

```text
No custom training at first.
Collect corrected outputs.
```

GPU:

```text
No.
```

## Model / component 3: vector line classifier

Purpose:

```text
Classify lines as wall, hatch, dimension, furniture, door, unknown.
```

Start with:

```text
rules
```

Then:

```text
Random Forest / XGBoost / LightGBM
```

Training data needed:

```text
Maybe 20–50 corrected projects/pages to start.
Better at 100–300 pages.
```

GPU:

```text
No.
```

This is probably your first real custom ML model.

## Model / component 4: candidate polygon generator

Purpose:

```text
Take likely walls and generate possible room polygons.
```

This is not necessarily ML.

Start with:

```text
geometry algorithms
```

Training data needed:

```text
No training at first.
Uses output from line classifier.
```

GPU:

```text
No.
```

It improves when the line classifier improves.

## Model / component 5: room-label matcher

Purpose:

```text
Attach “Room 101 Sales Office LVT-1” to the correct polygon.
```

Start with:

```text
spatial rules + LLM fallback
```

Then train:

```text
pairwise classifier
```

Example:

```text
Input: text block + polygon relationship
Output: belongs / does not belong
```

Training data needed:

```text
100–500 corrected room labels to start.
```

GPU:

```text
No.
```

## Model / component 6: polygon quality scorer

Purpose:

```text
Predict whether a candidate polygon is likely acceptable.
```

Start with:

```text
rule confidence
```

Then train:

```text
classifier/regression model
```

Label:

```text
accepted_without_edit = yes/no
or
area_error_before_correction
```

Training data needed:

```text
100–500 candidate polygons to start.
1,000+ better.
```

GPU:

```text
No.
```

## Model / component 7: room-area segmentation model

Purpose:

```text
Look at the page image and suggest room/floor-area masks, especially when vector data is bad.
```

Start with:

```text
SAM-style prompting / API / manual correction
```

Train later:

```text
YOLOv8-seg, Mask R-CNN, SegFormer, U-Net-style model, etc.
```

Training data needed:

```text
Minimum useful: maybe 200–500 approved polygons.
Better: 1,000–5,000+ approved room polygons.
```

GPU:

```text
Yes, for training.
Maybe not for inference if using hosted model/API.
```

This is V3, not V1.

## 8. What is COCO export and why does it matter?

COCO is just a common dataset format for object detection and instance segmentation. It stores images plus annotations like bounding boxes and segmentation polygons/masks. CVAT describes COCO as a popular format for object detection and instance segmentation and a common safe default because many annotation and training tools support it. citeturn772481search1

For you, COCO export means:

```text
Take page image
+
approved room polygons
+
finish labels
=
training dataset
```

Example:

```json
{
  "images": [
    {
      "id": 12,
      "file_name": "page_012.png",
      "width": 3300,
      "height": 2550
    }
  ],
  "annotations": [
    {
      "image_id": 12,
      "category_id": 1,
      "segmentation": [[500, 820, 900, 820, 900, 1130, 500, 1130]],
      "bbox": [500, 820, 400, 310],
      "area": 124000
    }
  ],
  "categories": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "floor_area"
    }
  ]
}
```

That is what you train segmentation on later.

## 9. “Original one and new ones” — how versioning works

This is important.

You do not replace your algorithm blindly.

Every candidate polygon should store:

```text
generated_by_model_version
```

Example:

```text
geom_rules_v0
geom_rules_v1
line_classifier_rf_v1
line_classifier_xgb_v2
sam_polygon_v1
```

When you improve the system, you run the new version on the same saved test pages.

Example:

```text
Evaluation set:
50 pages with approved polygons

Run old version:
area error before correction: 14%
accepted without edit: 22%

Run new version:
area error before correction: 8%
accepted without edit: 41%
```

Then you deploy the new version.

That is how you avoid lying to yourself.

## 10. Should you use Google Sheets?

No, not necessarily.

That was from the earlier product idea where Sheets was the bid engine.

For this version, ignore Google Sheets unless the user actually wants exports.

Your core product is:

```text
PDF → takeoff UI → approved rooms/finishes/SF → internal estimate database
```

Export can come later:

```text
Excel
CSV
Procore
Estimate template
Google Sheets
```

But it is not required for the AI loop.

## 11. What should Claude Code / Codex do first?

Give them tasks like this, in order.

### Task 1: build PDF extraction proof of concept

Ask it to build:

```text
Python script:
- input: PDF
- output:
  - page PNG images
  - text_blocks.json
  - vector_entities.json
  - debug_overlay.png for each page
```

This proves whether your PDFs contain useful vector data.

### Task 2: build vector overlay viewer

Ask it to build:

```text
Web UI:
- show rendered page image
- overlay vector entities
- toggle all lines/text blocks
- click a line and inspect metadata
```

### Task 3: build manual polygon editor

Ask it to build:

```text
Canvas UI:
- draw polygon
- move vertices
- add/delete vertices
- assign room name
- assign finish code
- set scale
- calculate SF
- save approved polygon
```

### Task 4: build correction event logging

Ask it to build:

```text
Every polygon edit logs:
- edit type
- before geometry
- after geometry
- area before
- area after
- optional reason
```

### Task 5: build first rule-based classifier

Ask it to build:

```text
classify_vector_entities.py

Labels:
- likely_wall
- likely_hatch
- likely_dimension
- likely_door
- likely_furniture
- unknown

Use:
- length
- angle
- stroke width
- dash pattern
- parallel repetition
- proximity to text
```

### Task 6: build candidate polygon generator

Ask it to build:

```text
generate_candidate_polygons.py

Steps:
- use likely_wall lines
- snap close endpoints
- bridge small gaps
- polygonize
- filter tiny/skinny/weird polygons
- output candidates
```

### Task 7: build evaluation harness

Ask it to build:

```text
evaluate_takeoff.py

Compare candidate polygons to approved polygons:
- IoU
- area error %
- missed rooms
- false rooms
- accepted without edit
```

Without this eval harness, you cannot know whether the system is improving.

## 12. What happens between job 1 and job 50?

Very specifically:

### After each job

You now have:

```text
page image
vector lines
text blocks
AI candidates
final approved polygons
correction events
```

### A scheduled script runs

It creates labels:

```text
Lines touching approved polygon boundary → likely wall/boundary
Lines inside polygon but repeatedly parallel → hatch
Dashed lines with nearby numbers → dimension
Curves near wall gaps → door swing
Lines removed during correction → likely false boundary
```

### It creates training examples

For each line:

```text
features → label
```

For each text block/polygon pair:

```text
relationship features → belongs or does not belong
```

For each candidate polygon:

```text
polygon features → accepted / edited / rejected
```

### Around job 50

You train first CPU models:

```text
line_classifier_v1
label_matcher_v1
polygon_quality_v1
```

Then compare them against your old rules.

If better, deploy.

That is the full loop.

## 13. Recommended build order

Here is the order I would actually use.

### Month 1: no ML

Build:

```text
PDF extraction
image rendering
text extraction
vector extraction
overlay viewer
manual polygon editor
scale calibration
area calculation
approved polygon storage
correction logging
```

Goal:

> Can an estimator do a takeoff and produce reliable SF?

### Month 2: rules + candidate polygons

Build:

```text
rule-based line classifier
candidate polygon generator
text-to-polygon matching
finish-code suggestion
confidence scoring
evaluation harness
```

Goal:

> Can the system suggest useful areas before the estimator draws manually?

### Month 3+: small ML

Train:

```text
line classifier
room-label matcher
polygon quality scorer
```

Goal:

> Reduce bad candidates and correction time.

### Later: segmentation

Train or integrate:

```text
room-area segmentation model
door/symbol detector
finish/hatch recognition
```

Goal:

> Improve messy/scanned plans where vector parsing is weak.

## Final answer

The best way to start is **not GPUs** and not a huge model.

Start with:

```text
1. Extract page images
2. Extract text blocks
3. Extract vector entities
4. Build overlay viewer
5. Build manual polygon editor
6. Save approved polygons
7. Save correction events
8. Add rule-based candidate polygons
9. Create evaluation set
10. Train small CPU classifiers only after enough corrections
```

Your first custom models are probably:

```text
1. Vector line classifier — CPU
2. Room-label matcher — CPU
3. Polygon quality scorer — CPU
```

Your later GPU model is:

```text
4. Room-area segmentation model — GPU later, once you have hundreds/thousands of approved polygons
```

So the system does not learn by magic. It learns because you force every estimator correction into a structured database, then use those corrections to improve rules, train small classifiers, measure improvement, and eventually train segmentation.

## Turn 9 - User

Script 4: create debug overlay images

This is huge.

Take the rendered page image and draw the extracted stuff on top:

blue = extracted text boxes
red = vector lines
green = possible room polygons
yellow = ignored hatch/dimension candidates

Output:

/debug/page_001_overlay.png explain this more please as far as how to build it what it does etc  so is this code Long solid thick line → possible wall
Dashed thin line → possible dimension
Many repeated parallel thin lines → hatch
Curved arc near wall gap → possible door
Tiny repeated object → possible furniture/symbol
Text-like box or underline → ignore ike these rules I don't understand that and why you wouldn't do deep learning you are right I am wrong lets assume just trying to learn should I use this stack A geometry library can calculate polygon area after you have a scale. PostGIS, for example, has polygon area functions such as ST_Area, but you can also calculate this in Python or JavaScript depending on your stack. or some hybrid need best possible  so this nightly job Was this line part of the final approved room boundary?
Was it inside the room but not part of boundary?
Was it a hatch?
Was it a dimension?
Was it removed by the estimator?
Was it near a door gap? is just to store the data in the databases for future deep learning ?  Job 30–50: train small classifier

Now you train a small model:

Input: vector line features
Output: wall / hatch / dimension / furniture / door / unknown

This can be a normal CPU model. why cpu not GPU for this  yeah I will use RunPod not buy gputs runpod you cant get insane GPUs for like 1 to 5 10 an hour you know  explain this more LLM API first.
Later small text/image classifier. "This is probably your first real custom ML mode" but no GPUs ? explain this more please PDF extraction
image rendering
text extraction
vector extraction
overlay viewer
manual polygon editor
scale calibration
area calculation
approved polygon storage
correction logging  so I'm  reayI'm really confused in terms of how to think of this or how to get started on this, because like, okay, we have the vision and the models that we need to run. And then you mentioned my things, Azure DevCodex and Claude. How should I think of it? Should I do it as like, okay, I'm going to need these six or seven models to complete it? Like, everything I do with Claude and Codex now revolves around setting those models up and, you know, doing what we need to do to build those out. Like, I don't know how to structure my thoughts, I guess, for like, organizing the project. And steps Try to do it like at Elon, you know, first principles thinking.

---

## Turn 10 - Assistant

I’m going to reframe this from the ground up: not “what models do I need,” but “what must be true for a takeoff number to be trusted.” Then I’ll map code, rules, ML, GPUs, Claude/Codex, and RunPod into that.

You’re thinking about it like:

> “Do I need to set up 6–7 AI models first?”

I would **not** think about it that way.

Think about it from first principles:

> **A flooring takeoff number is only real if you have:**
> 1. a page,
> 2. a scale,
> 3. a polygon,
> 4. a finish assignment,
> 5. a human-approved source of truth.

Everything else — vector extraction, deep learning, Claude, Codex, RunPod, rules, overlays — exists to make those five things faster and more accurate.

## The simple mental model

Your system has three layers:

```text
Layer 1: Evidence
- page image
- vector lines
- text boxes
- symbols
- hatches
- schedule data

Layer 2: Guesses
- likely walls
- likely hatches
- likely room polygons
- likely room names
- likely finishes

Layer 3: Truth
- estimator-approved polygon
- approved room name
- approved finish
- approved SF
```

You do **not** train first.

You first build the system that collects **truth**.

Then models get better because they are trained against truth.

---

# 1. What the debug overlay does

The debug overlay is your “X-ray view” of the PDF.

You render the page as a normal image, then draw the extracted data on top of it.

Example:

```text
Normal page image:
The blueprint page as the estimator sees it.

Overlay:
Blue boxes = extracted text
Red lines = extracted vector lines
Yellow lines = things the system thinks are hatches/dimensions/junk
Green polygons = possible room areas
```

It is not the final product UI. It is a developer/debugging tool.

Its job is to answer:

> “Is my extraction even working?”

Because before you build AI, you need to know:

- Did the PDF have vector data?
- Did the vector lines align with the rendered image?
- Did text extraction find room labels?
- Did it detect too many junk lines?
- Are hatches being mistaken for walls?
- Are candidate polygons obviously wrong?
- Are scale and coordinates lining up?

PyMuPDF can extract vector drawings from PDF pages; its `get_drawings()` output gives path/drawing information from the page instead of only a flat image. citeturn759459search0turn759459search4

## What it looks like conceptually

Imagine the room plan visually looks like this:

```text
+------------------------+
| 101 SALES OFFICE       |
| LVT-1                  |
|                        |
+-----------    ---------+
            door gap
```

The overlay might show:

```text
Red lines:
- wall segments

Blue boxes:
- "101 SALES OFFICE"
- "LVT-1"

Yellow:
- dimension strings
- hatch lines
- furniture/symbol lines

Green:
- proposed room polygon
```

Then you can instantly see:

> “Oh, the system sees the walls but missed the door gap.”
> “Oh, it thinks hatch lines are room boundaries.”
> “Oh, text boxes are shifted 80 pixels down.”
> “Oh, this PDF has no useful vector data.”

That saves you weeks of guessing.

---

# 2. How to build the debug overlay

You build it as a Python script first.

Not a full web app. Not deep learning. Just a local proof of concept.

## Inputs

```text
input.pdf
```

## Outputs

```text
/output/page_001.png
/output/page_001_text_blocks.json
/output/page_001_vector_entities.json
/output/page_001_overlay.png
```

## Pipeline

```text
1. Open PDF with PyMuPDF
2. Render page to PNG
3. Extract text blocks with bounding boxes
4. Extract vector drawing paths/lines
5. Convert PDF coordinates to image pixel coordinates
6. Draw colored overlays on top of page PNG
7. Save debug PNG
```

The key is coordinate conversion.

PDF coordinates and image pixels are not automatically the same thing. If your rendered page is 300 DPI, you need to transform the PDF’s coordinate system into the image coordinate system.

That means every text box and vector line needs to become:

```text
x1_px, y1_px, x2_px, y2_px
```

So you can draw it over the image.

## The overlay script should draw

```text
Text blocks:
blue rectangle around each text bbox
small blue label with extracted text

Vector lines:
red line for every extracted vector segment

Classified junk:
yellow line for likely hatch/dimension/furniture/etc.

Candidate polygons:
green outline and translucent fill
```

At first, the overlay will be ugly. That is fine. It is for debugging.

---

# 3. Are these rules actual code?

Yes.

This:

```text
Long solid thick line → possible wall
Dashed thin line → possible dimension
Many repeated parallel thin lines → hatch
Curved arc near wall gap → possible door
Tiny repeated object → possible furniture/symbol
Text-like box or underline → ignore
```

becomes code.

But it starts as **heuristics**, not perfect intelligence.

A heuristic is just a useful rule.

Example:

```text
If a line is dashed, thin, and near dimension text, classify it as likely_dimension.
```

Another:

```text
If there are 40 short diagonal lines with the same angle and spacing, classify them as hatch.
```

Another:

```text
If a curved arc is near a wall gap, classify it as likely_door.
```

You are not saying the rule is always right.

You are saying:

> “This is a good first guess, and the estimator can correct it.”

Those corrections become training data later.

---

# 4. Why not deep learning first?

Because at the beginning, you do not have labels.

Deep learning needs examples like:

```text
This line = wall
This line = hatch
This line = dimension
This polygon = correct room
This polygon = wrong room
This text = belongs to this room
```

Without that, deep learning is guessing.

The rule-based system is how you bootstrap the dataset.

So the order is:

```text
Rules → human corrections → labeled data → small ML → better suggestions → more corrections → better model
```

Not:

```text
Deep learning → magically understands flooring takeoff
```

You are not “wrong” for thinking about deep learning. You are just thinking one stage too early.

Deep learning is later. The first battle is creating the labeled truth.

---

# 5. Should you use Shapely, PostGIS, JavaScript, or a hybrid?

Best possible answer: **hybrid**.

## Use Python for PDF + geometry processing

Use Python for:

```text
PDF rendering
text extraction
vector extraction
line classification
polygon generation
training data export
evaluation scripts
```

Tools:

```text
PyMuPDF
Shapely
OpenCV
scikit-learn
possibly NetworkX
```

Shapely can create polygons and polygonize linework into polygons from planar line geometry. citeturn759459search1turn759459search12

## Use Postgres/PostGIS for storing final geometry

Use Postgres/PostGIS for:

```text
approved polygons
candidate polygons
area storage
spatial queries
overlaps
containment
versioning
```

PostGIS `ST_Area` returns the area of polygonal geometry in the geometry’s coordinate units, which is useful once you have scale handled correctly. citeturn759459search2

## Use frontend canvas for editing

Use the frontend for:

```text
viewing page image
turning overlays on/off
drawing polygon
moving vertices
assigning room/finish
approving/correcting candidates
```

Possible frontend tools:

```text
React + Konva
React + Fabric.js
SVG overlay
Canvas overlay
```

My recommendation:

```text
Python service = extraction + geometry brain
Postgres/PostGIS = source of truth
Next.js UI = estimator review/editing
RunPod = later GPU training/inference only when needed
```

# 6. Is the nightly job just storing data for future deep learning?

No. It does more than store.

The nightly job turns messy user activity into structured training/evaluation data.

During the day, the estimator does this:

```text
AI suggests polygon
Estimator edits it
Estimator approves final shape
```

At night, the job asks:

```text
What did the estimator change?
Which lines were used in the wrong polygon?
Which lines are on the final approved boundary?
Which text labels were attached correctly?
Which finish codes were changed?
Which candidate polygons were accepted without edit?
Which ones were deleted?
```

Then it creates structured examples.

Example:

```text
line_882:
features = length, angle, width, dash, color, repetition_score, nearby_text
label = hatch
```

Another:

```text
candidate_polygon_21:
features = area, shape complexity, number of wall-like edges, text inside, finish code inside
label = accepted_without_edit: false
area_error_before_correction: 14.2%
```

Another:

```text
text_block_99 + polygon_21:
features = distance_to_centroid, inside_polygon, leader_line_nearby
label = belongs_to_polygon: true
```

So the nightly job creates:

```text
training rows
evaluation rows
mistake summaries
model metrics
new prompt examples
```

It is the bridge from “human corrected something” to “the system can learn from it.”

---

# 7. Why CPU for the first model, not GPU?

Because the first model is not a giant image model.

The first useful model is probably:

```text
Input:
line length
line angle
stroke width
dash pattern
color
nearby text
parallel repetition score
distance to other lines
inside/outside approved polygon

Output:
wall / hatch / dimension / door / furniture / unknown
```

That is **tabular data**.

For tabular data, models like Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, or logistic regression are often more practical than a neural network.

A Random Forest is a set of decision trees trained on feature rows; scikit-learn’s RandomForestClassifier is built for this kind of supervised classification. citeturn759459search3

You do not need a GPU to train that.

A GPU is useful for:

```text
image segmentation
object detection
large neural networks
vision model fine-tuning
large batch inference
```

A GPU is usually unnecessary for:

```text
Random Forest
logistic regression
small tabular classifiers
geometry rules
PDF parsing
text extraction
polygon area calculation
```

RunPod is still useful later. RunPod offers on-demand GPU/CPU infrastructure and serverless GPU endpoints for containerized inference workloads. citeturn807914search15turn807914search7

But early on, paying for huge GPUs would not solve the main missing thing:

> You do not yet have enough approved labels.

---

# 8. “LLM API first, later small classifier” — what does that mean?

Example: page classification.

At first, you can use an LLM/VLM API to ask:

```text
Is this page:
- floor plan
- finish schedule
- legend
- detail
- elevation
- spec page?
```

Why use LLM first?

Because you may only have 10–20 plans. You do not have training data yet.

After 100–300 pages, you now have labels:

```text
page_001 = floor plan
page_002 = finish schedule
page_003 = detail
page_004 = legend
```

Then you can train a cheaper small classifier.

Same for finish extraction:

At first:

```text
LLM reads finish schedule and outputs structured JSON.
```

Later:

```text
Your app has hundreds of corrected finish schedules.
Now you can make deterministic parsers or train smaller extractors for common formats.
```

So:

```text
LLM first = flexible bootstrap
small classifier later = cheaper, faster, repeatable
```

---

# 9. How to organize your thinking

Do **not** organize the project around “models.”

Organize it around **product loops**.

## Loop 1: Takeoff loop

This is the core user workflow.

```text
Upload PDF
↓
Pick page
↓
Set scale
↓
Draw/approve room polygon
↓
Assign finish
↓
Calculate SF
↓
Approve
```

If this loop does not work, nothing else matters.

## Loop 2: Evidence loop

This is what the machine extracts.

```text
Render image
Extract text
Extract vectors
Classify obvious elements
Show overlay
```

This tells you what the PDF contains.

## Loop 3: Suggestion loop

This is where automation starts.

```text
Likely wall lines
↓
Candidate polygons
↓
Candidate labels
↓
Candidate finishes
↓
Confidence score
```

These are guesses, not truth.

## Loop 4: Learning loop

This is where the system improves.

```text
Estimator corrects
↓
Correction is logged
↓
Nightly job creates labels
↓
Rules/models are improved
↓
New version is evaluated
↓
Deploy only if better
```

That is the structure.

Not:

```text
Model 1, model 2, model 3, model 4...
```

Models are just tools inside the loops.

# 10. First-principles build plan

## Principle 1: Square footage comes from polygons

So first build:

```text
page image viewer
scale calibration
polygon drawing/editing
area calculation
approved polygon storage
```

Without this, you do not have a takeoff product.

## Principle 2: AI suggestions are worthless unless they can be corrected

So build:

```text
candidate polygon overlay
accept/edit/delete
correction logging
before/after geometry
```

## Principle 3: Models need labels

So build:

```text
approved_polygons
polygon_edit_events
training_examples
model_versions
evaluation_sets
```

## Principle 4: Never trust a new model without measuring it

So build:

```text
evaluation script
old version vs new version
area error
IoU
finish accuracy
correction time
accept-without-edit rate
```

## Principle 5: Use the cheapest tool that works

That means:

```text
rules before ML
CPU ML before GPU ML
geometry before vision when vector data is available
human approval before bid-grade output
```

That is the “first principles” way.

# 11. What Claude Code and Codex should do

Claude Code and Codex are not your takeoff model.

They are your engineering workforce.

Claude Code is a CLI that can work in a code project from the terminal, edit files, run commands, and manage project work. citeturn635840search1 Codex can read, edit, and run code, fix bugs, answer codebase questions, and work in cloud environments. citeturn807914search4turn807914search0

Use them like this:

```text
You define architecture and acceptance criteria.
Claude/Codex write scripts, UI, database schema, tests, and evaluation tools.
You inspect outputs and steer.
```

Do not ask them:

```text
“Build AI takeoff.”
```

Ask them:

```text
“Build a Python script that renders each PDF page, extracts text blocks, extracts vector drawings, converts coordinates to image pixels, and saves a debug overlay image.”
```

Then:

```text
“Build a React page viewer that loads page image + text_blocks.json + vector_entities.json and lets me toggle each layer.”
```

Then:

```text
“Build a polygon editor that lets a user draw, edit, save, and approve room polygons.”
```

Then:

```text
“Build correction-event logging so every geometry edit stores before/after shape and edit type.”
```

That is how you use AI coding tools productively.

# 12. The actual project structure

I would structure the repo like this:

```text
takeoff-app/
  apps/
    web/                  # Next.js estimator UI
    api/                  # API routes / backend
  services/
    pdf-worker/            # Python PDF extraction service
    geometry-worker/       # polygon generation, line classification
    training-worker/       # dataset export, small ML training
  packages/
    shared-types/          # project/page/polygon schemas
  db/
    migrations/
    seed/
  storage/
    sample_plans/
    debug_outputs/

    render_pages.py
    extract_text.py
    extract_vectors.py
    create_debug_overlay.py
    classify_vector_entities.py
    generate_candidate_polygons.py
    evaluate_takeoff.py
```

This makes the thinking cleaner.

The first thing you build is not a model.

The first thing you build is:

```text
PDF → image/text/vector/debug overlay
```

Then:

```text
image/text/vector → manual polygon approval
```

Then:

```text
manual approvals → training/evaluation data
```

Then:

```text
training/evaluation data → better automation
```

# 13. What “best possible” V1 should be

V1 should not be “dumb.” It should be **data-smart**.

Build this:

```text
1. Upload PDF
2. Render page images
3. Extract text
4. Extract vectors
5. Create debug overlays
6. Web viewer with layers:
   - page image
   - text boxes
   - vector lines
   - likely walls
   - likely hatches/dimensions
7. Scale calibration
8. Manual polygon drawing/editing
9. Area calculation
10. Room/finish assignment
11. Approved polygon storage
12. Correction event logging
13. Export final quantities to CSV/Excel/internal estimate
```

Forget Google Sheets if it is not part of this product. The important thing is approved quantities in your own database.

# 14. V1 → V2 technical process

V2 is where auto-suggestions start.

## V2 component A: rule-based vector classifier

Input:

```text
all vector lines
```

Output:

```text
likely_wall
likely_hatch
likely_dimension
likely_door
likely_symbol
unknown
```

This starts as code.

## V2 component B: candidate polygon generator

Input:

```text
likely_wall lines
```

Process:

```text
snap nearby endpoints
bridge likely door gaps
polygonize linework
filter tiny/weird polygons
```

Shapely’s `polygonize` creates polygons from linework when the lines form valid closed polygon edges. citeturn759459search12

Output:

```text
possible room polygons
```

## V2 component C: label matcher

Input:

```text
candidate polygons + text blocks
```

Rules:

```text
text inside polygon
nearest polygon centroid
leader lines
finish-code pattern
room-number pattern
```

Output:

```text
Room 101 / Sales Office / LVT-1
```

## V2 component D: confidence scorer

Input:

```text
polygon quality
text match quality
finish match quality
scale confidence
```

Output:

```text
high / medium / low confidence
```

Low confidence gets reviewed first.

---

# 15. V2 → V3 technical process

V3 is where real custom ML starts.

## First custom ML model: vector line classifier

This is probably your first real custom model.

Input:

```text
line features
```

Features:

```text
length
angle
stroke width
dash pattern
color
parallel repetition score
nearby text count
nearby arc count
inside approved polygon
touches approved boundary
distance to nearest room label
```

Output:

```text
wall
hatch
dimension
door
furniture/symbol
unknown
```

Model candidates:

```text
Random Forest
XGBoost
LightGBM
logistic regression
```

GPU:

```text
No
```

Data needed:

```text
20–50 corrected pages to start
100–300 corrected pages better
```

## Second custom ML model: room-label matcher

Input:

```text
text block + candidate polygon pair
```

Features:

```text
is text inside polygon
distance to polygon center
text pattern
room-number-like?
finish-code-like?
leader line nearby?
same zone?
```

Output:

```text
belongs_to_polygon: yes/no
```

GPU:

```text
No
```

Data needed:

```text
100–500 corrected room labels to start
```

## Third custom ML model: polygon quality scorer

Input:

```text
candidate polygon features
```

Output:

```text
accepted without edit?
likely area error?
needs review?
```

GPU:

```text
No
```

Data needed:

```text
100–500 candidate polygons to start
1,000+ better
```

## Fourth model later: room-area segmentation

Input:

```text
page image
possibly vector overlay channels
```

Output:

```text
room/floor-area masks
```

Model candidates:

```text
SAM-assisted pipeline
YOLOv8-seg
Mask R-CNN
SegFormer
U-Net variant
```

GPU:

```text
Yes, likely RunPod
```

Data needed:

```text
Minimum: 200–500 approved polygons for experiments
Better: 1,000–5,000+ approved polygons
```

This is where RunPod becomes useful.

---

# 16. How the system gets better by job 50

Very literally:

## Job 1

Rules say:

```text
line_1 = wall
line_2 = wall
line_3 = wall
line_4 = wall
line_5 = hatch but system thinks wall
```

Candidate polygon is wrong.

Estimator deletes/edits it.

System stores:

```text
line_5 was used in wrong candidate polygon
line_5 is not on approved final boundary
line_5 is inside final polygon
line_5 is part of repeated diagonal group
edit_type = removed_wrong_boundary
```

## Job 10

You have 200 examples of hatch lines and 300 examples of wall lines.

You improve the rule:

```text
If repeated diagonal parallel lines with consistent spacing, mark as hatch.
```

## Job 30

You have thousands of line examples.

Now you train:

```text
line_classifier_v1
```

It learns patterns like:

```text
walls tend to be longer, connected, orthogonal, boundary-touching
hatches tend to be repeated, thinner, diagonal, inside a larger region
dimensions tend to be dashed/thin and near numbers
doors tend to have arcs and sit in wall gaps
```

## Job 50

You run evaluation:

```text
old rules:
hatch mistaken as wall 31% of time

new classifier:
hatch mistaken as wall 12% of time
```

Now candidate polygons are cleaner.

That is what “it learns” means.

---

# 17. What to do next — exact starting sequence

Do this in order.

## Step 1: Build extraction POC

Prompt Claude/Codex:

```text
Build a Python proof-of-concept for construction plan PDFs.

Input: a PDF path.
Output for each page:
1. rendered PNG at 300 DPI
2. text_blocks.json with text and pixel-space bounding boxes
3. vector_entities.json with line/path geometry converted to pixel coordinates
4. debug_overlay.png showing:
   - blue text boxes
   - red vector lines
   - labels for page number and dimensions

Use PyMuPDF. Keep the code modular:
- render_pages.py
- extract_text.py
- extract_vectors.py
- create_debug_overlay.py
```

## Step 2: Run it on 5–10 real plans

Do not build more until you inspect the overlays.

You need to know:

```text
Are these PDFs vector-heavy or raster-heavy?
Does text extraction work?
Are vectors aligned?
How noisy are the lines?
```

## Step 3: Build web viewer

Prompt:

```text
Build a Next.js page viewer that loads:
- page image
- text_blocks.json
- vector_entities.json

Add toggles:
- show text boxes
- show all vector lines
- show likely walls
- show likely hatches/dimensions
- show candidate polygons

Use a canvas/SVG overlay.
```

## Step 4: Build manual takeoff

Prompt:

```text
Add polygon drawing/editing:
- click to create polygon vertices
- drag vertices
- add/delete vertex
- set scale
- calculate area SF
- assign room name
- assign room number
- assign finish code
- approve polygon
- save to database
```

## Step 5: Build correction logging

Prompt:

```text
Every polygon edit must create a polygon_edit_event:
- edit_type
- before_geometry
- after_geometry
- area_before
- area_after
- user_id
- timestamp
```

## Step 6: Add rules

Prompt:

```text
Create a rule-based vector classifier.

Classify vector entities as:
- likely_wall
- likely_hatch
- likely_dimension
- likely_door
- likely_symbol
- unknown

Use geometric features:
- length
- angle
- stroke width
- dash pattern
- color
- repetition score
- nearby text
- nearby arcs
```

## Step 7: Add candidate polygons

Prompt:

```text
Using likely_wall lines:
- snap endpoints within threshold
- bridge small likely door gaps
- polygonize closed linework
- filter tiny/skinny polygons
- score candidates
- save candidate_polygons
```

## Step 8: Add evaluation

Prompt:

```text
Build evaluate_takeoff.py.

Compare candidate polygons to approved polygons:
- IoU
- area error %
- missed approved rooms
- false candidate rooms
- accepted without edit rate
```

This is when you are ready to start improving intelligently.

---

# Final way to think about it

Do **not** start with:

> “I need seven models.”

Start with:

> “I need a system that turns PDFs into approved polygons and stores every correction.”

Then:

```text
Claude/Codex = engineering agents that build the system
LLM/VLM APIs = flexible helpers for page/text/finish understanding
Rules = first automation layer
CPU ML = first custom learning layer
RunPod GPU = later segmentation/deep-learning layer
Estimator corrections = the asset that makes everything improve
```

The first real goal is not “AI takeoff.”

The first real goal is:

> **Build the machine that creates the training data while still being useful as a manual/semi-automatic takeoff tool.**

---

## Turn 11 - User

Okay, when it comes to the pages, is that like, and you say page 1, 4 plan, page 2, finish schedule, is that like the title that they give it, or is that just like what we're classifying it as? So tell me about how the scale works. Is that like per page on a project, or like per room, or per... Like, explain that a little bit more. Yes, so for number 10, principle 1, kind of going back, I don't understand the whole... How it works, like, scaled calibration, all that. Like, if I did a GPU for something that needed CPU, would there be any downside or would it just be more expensive but quicker? Okay, so for what best possible view launch should be, give me the database schema for that. Let's model a little bit more of what it's doing. When you say a thousand to five thousand polygons, you have multiple polygons on one set of points with Project 3. What is 300 DPI? For step one, give me the database schema to your list and how it relates to our V1. This looks really, really good and detailed. Do you think that other, you know, bigger ones, big companies like the ones that are out there now, do you think they were able to get it this good with, you know, because AI wasn't as good as it is now? I guess what would be the end goal for it to like, auto-suggest things, like run, you know, spare footage and taking off, and it's like a really good user interface on how to verify or what?

---

## Turn 12 - Assistant

I’ll answer this in chunks: page classification, scale/DPI, GPU vs CPU, the V1 database schema, what “1,000–5,000 polygons” really means, and the actual end goal.

Yes — this is exactly the right place to slow down. The clean way to think about this is:

> **The app is not “a bunch of models.” The app is a measurement system.**
> The models only help suggest things inside that system.

The trusted takeoff number comes from:

```text
plan page → correct scale → approved polygon → finish assignment → square footage
```

Everything else is support.

---

# 1. Page 1 = floor plan, page 2 = finish schedule — title or classification?

Usually both exist, but they are different.

A PDF page may have a **real sheet title** printed on it, like:

```text
A1.01 — First Floor Plan
A6.01 — Finish Schedule
ID2.10 — Enlarged Restroom Plan
```

That is the architect’s title.

Your app also stores its own **page classification**, like:

```text
floor_plan
finish_schedule
legend
detail
elevation
spec_page
cover_sheet
unknown
```

So for one page, you might store:

```text
pdf_page_number: 4
sheet_number: A1.01
sheet_title: First Floor Plan
page_type: floor_plan
```

The sheet title comes from the document.
The page type is what **your system classifies it as**.

Why this matters:

```text
Floor plan pages → takeoff polygons
Finish schedule pages → finish code extraction
Legend pages → symbol/finish meaning
Detail pages → usually not main area takeoff
Cover pages → mostly ignored
```

So your page classifier helps route the page to the right workflow.

---

# 2. What is scale?

Scale is what turns pixels or PDF coordinates into real-world feet.

The computer only knows:

```text
This polygon is 240,000 pixels wide/area
```

But you need:

```text
This room is 842 square feet
```

To convert, you need scale.

## Simple example

Suppose the plan says:

```text
1/8" = 1'-0"
```

That means:

```text
1 inch on the printed drawing = 8 feet in real life
```

But your app is not measuring paper inches directly. It is measuring pixels.

So the calibration is:

```text
pixels → drawing inches → real feet
```

A more practical app workflow is:

```text
User clicks two known points on a dimension line.
Example: this wall is labeled 20'-0".
The app measures the pixel distance between the clicks.
Now the app knows pixels-per-foot.
```

Example:

```text
User clicks both ends of a 20 ft dimension.
Pixel distance = 600 px.

600 px = 20 ft
30 px = 1 ft
```

Now a polygon area in pixels can become square feet.

---

# 3. Is scale per project, page, room, or something else?

Best answer: **scale should be stored per page/view/measurement layer, not just per project.**

A project can have many sheets with different scales.

Example:

```text
A1.01 Overall Floor Plan: 1/8" = 1'-0"
A1.11 Enlarged Restroom Plan: 1/4" = 1'-0"
A5.01 Details: 3" = 1'-0"
```

Even worse, one page can contain multiple drawings at different scales:

```text
Left side: overall floor plan, 1/8" = 1'-0"
Right side: enlarged detail, 1/4" = 1'-0"
Bottom: section detail, 1" = 1'-0"
```

So for V1, I would model scale like this:

```text
project
  plan_page
    scale_calibration
      applies to whole page OR a specific viewport/region
```

For flooring takeoff, most of the time you care about the floor plan viewport.

So each approved polygon should point to the scale calibration used.

```text
approved_polygon
- geometry_px
- scale_calibration_id
- area_sf
```

That way, if the user later fixes scale, you can recalculate the area.

---

# 4. What is scale calibration in the UI?

The estimator does something like this:

1. Opens the page.
2. Clicks “Set Scale.”
3. Clicks point A and point B on a known dimension line.
4. Enters the real distance, like `20 ft`.
5. App calculates pixels-per-foot.
6. Every polygon using that calibration can now calculate square footage.

Example:

```text
Point A: [1000, 500]
Point B: [1600, 500]
Pixel distance: 600 px
User enters: 20 ft
Scale: 30 px per ft
```

Then if a room polygon has an area of `756,000 px²`:

```text
area_sf = pixel_area / (px_per_ft²)

area_sf = 756,000 / (30 * 30)
area_sf = 840 SF
```

That is the core math.

---

# 5. What is 300 DPI?

DPI means **dots per inch**.

In your case, think of it as:

> **How many pixels the PDF page gets rendered into.**

A higher DPI image has more detail.

PyMuPDF supports rendering a PDF page to an image at a chosen DPI, for example `page.get_pixmap(dpi=300)`, and its docs specifically show 300 DPI rendering. citeturn529930search2

Typical options:

```text
150 DPI = lighter/faster, less detail
200 DPI = decent for web preview
300 DPI = sharper, better for OCR/vision, heavier files
```

For construction plans, I’d start with:

```text
Render preview: 150–200 DPI
Render analysis/debug: 300 DPI
Use tiled/zoomed images later for big sheets
```

Because a 24x36 plan at 300 DPI can become a huge image.

---

# 6. If I use GPU for something CPU-like, is there downside?

Yes.

A GPU is not automatically faster.

For tasks like:

```text
PDF parsing
text extraction
vector extraction
basic geometry
Postgres queries
Random Forest classifiers
area calculations
```

a GPU usually does **nothing** unless the code is specifically written to use GPU libraries.

Possible downsides:

```text
More expensive
More setup
More data-transfer overhead
More deployment complexity
Sometimes slower for small/tabular tasks
```

Use RunPod/GPU for:

```text
segmentation models
object detection
fine-tuning vision models
running heavy image inference
large batch image processing
```

Do not use GPU just because it sounds stronger. Use it when the workload is actually parallel image/tensor math.

# 7. Best V1 database schema

This is a strong V1 schema for the product we are talking about: PDF takeoff, scale calibration, vector/text extraction, manual approval, correction logging, and future training.

## Core project tables

```sql
projects
- id
- name
- client_name
- status
- created_by_user_id
- created_at
- updated_at
```

```sql
plan_documents
- id
- project_id
- original_file_name
- file_url
- page_count
- processing_status
- created_at
```

A project can have multiple uploaded PDFs.

---

## Page tables

```sql
plan_pages
- id
- project_id
- document_id
- pdf_page_number
- sheet_number
- sheet_title
- page_type
- page_type_confidence
- width_px
- height_px
- width_pdf_points
- height_pdf_points
- rotation
- created_at
```

`page_type` is your classification:

```text
floor_plan
finish_schedule
legend
detail
cover
spec
unknown
```

```sql
page_images
- id
- page_id
- image_url
- dpi

`image_type` could be:

```text

## Text extraction tables

```sql
text_blocks
- id
- page_id
- text
- bbox_px
- bbox_pdf
- source
- confidence
- text_type_guess
- created_at
```

`text_type_guess` could be:

```text
room_label
room_number
finish_code
dimension
sheet_title
note
unknown
```

This is where room names, finish codes, dimensions, and schedule text live.

## Vector extraction tables

```sql
vector_entities

- geometry_px
- geometry_pdf
- stroke_width
- color
- dash_pattern

- created_at
```

`classifier_label` starts as rule-based:

```text
likely_wall
likely_hatch
likely_dimension
likely_door
likely_symbol
unknown
```

PyMuPDF can extract drawing/vector information from PDFs, but it gives raw path/line data, not automatic semantic meaning like “this is a room wall.” citeturn529930search2

## Scale tables

```sql
scale_calibrations

- scale_confirmed_by_user_id
- confidence
- created_at

```

`applies_to`:

```text

```

This is important because one page can have multiple scales.

## Approved takeoff area tables

This is the real takeoff truth.

```sql
approved_takeoff_areas
- id

- geometry_px
- area_px
- area_sf
- perimeter_lf
- waste_factor
- approved_by_user_id
- approved_at
- created_at
- updated_at
```

I would name this `approved_takeoff_areas`, not just `approved_polygons`, because it represents a real measured flooring area.

## Edit/correction logging

```sql

# 9. What does “1,000–5,000 polygons” mean?

A polygon is one measured shape.

One project can produce many polygons.

Example:

```text
Project 1:
- 40 rooms
- 5 corridors
- 3 restrooms
- 2 lobby/common areas
= around 50 approved polygons
```

So:

```text
20 projects × 50 polygons = 1,000 polygons
100 projects × 50 polygons = 5,000 polygons
```

You do **not** need 1,000–5,000 full projects.

You need 1,000–5,000 approved measured areas.

A single big gym/fitness project might have:

```text
rubber area polygon
turf polygon
LVT lobby polygon
men's locker room tile polygon
women's locker room tile polygon
hallway polygons
office polygons
group fitness polygon
spin room polygon
stretching area polygon
etc.
```

So one plan set can give many training examples.

But be careful: 1,000 polygons from only 3 projects is not as good as 1,000 polygons from 50 different architects/projects. Variety matters.

---

# 10. Did big companies get this good before AI was as good as now?

I cannot know their internal systems unless they publish it, but broadly: yes, bigger companies could build strong systems before today’s LLM/VLM boom by combining:

```text
traditional computer vision
OCR
PDF/vector parsing
geometry algorithms
large internal datasets
human review workflows
estimator feedback
lots of engineering time
```

Modern AI helps a lot with:

```text
page understanding
schedule extraction
legend interpretation
room/finish text reasoning
few-shot pattern recognition
natural language interface
developer speed with Claude/Codex
```

But modern AI does **not** remove the need for:

```text
scale calibration
polygon verification
human approval
error tracking
training/evaluation data
```

Current vendors still position their tools around AI-assisted workflows, takeoff automation, and/or human-reviewed outputs. Togal publicly markets AI-powered takeoff that detects and measures from drawings, while Beam describes combining automated takeoffs with human-reviewed outputs for reliable estimates. citeturn529930search0turn529930search1

That supports the same conclusion:

> The best product is not just “AI guesses.”
> The best product is “AI suggests, estimator verifies, system gets faster.”

---

# 11. What is the end goal?

The end goal should be:

> **Auto-suggest the takeoff, then give the estimator the fastest possible verification UI.**

Not:

> “Replace the estimator completely on day one.”

The ideal workflow:

```text
1. Upload PDF.
2. App finds floor plan pages.
3. App finds finish schedule and finish codes.
4. App detects scale or asks user to calibrate it.
5. App proposes room/area polygons.
6. App assigns likely room names and finishes.
7. App highlights low-confidence areas first.
8. Estimator accepts, edits, splits, merges, or rejects.
9. App calculates final SF from approved geometry.
10. Corrections become training data.
```

The magic is not that it never makes mistakes.

The magic is that the estimator can verify quickly.

A strong verification UI would show:

```text
Room 101 — Sales Office
Suggested finish: LVT-1
Suggested area: 842 SF
Confidence: 86%

Evidence:
- room label found inside polygon
- finish code found inside polygon
- polygon generated from likely wall boundaries
- scale calibrated from 20'-0" dimension
```

Then the estimator has buttons:

```text
Accept
Edit polygon
Change finish
Split room
Merge rooms
Exclude area
Mark not in scope
```

That is how you make it useful.

---

# 12. The real V1 goal

Your V1 should prove this:

> Can a user upload a plan, set scale, draw/approve polygons, assign finishes, and get reliable square footage while the system stores every correction for future automation?

That is the foundation.

The V2 goal:

> Can the system auto-suggest enough useful polygons/finishes that the estimator edits instead of starting from zero?

The V3 goal:

> Can the system learn from hundreds/thousands of approved polygons and reduce correction time dramatically?

So the first-principles roadmap is:

```text
V1: measurement truth machine
V2: suggestion machine
V3: learning machine
```

That is the cleanest way to structure the whole project.

## Turn 13 - User

Point A: [1000, 500]
Point B: [1600, 500]
Pixel distance: 600 px
User enters: 20 ft
Scale: 30 px per ft
 so would goal be ai maps this out like lines and calibration using our traing data and we just verify if its accurate ? 12. The real V1 goal

Your V1 should prove this:

Can a user upload a plan, set scale, draw/approve polygons, assign finishes, and get reliable square footage while the system stores every correction for future automation? Okay, when it comes to the pages, is that like, and you say page 1, 4 plan, page 2, finish schedule, is that like the title that they give it, or is that just like what we're classifying it as? So tell me about how the scale works. Is that like per page on a project, or like per room, or per... Like, explain that a little bit more. Yes, so for number 10, principle 1, kind of going back, I don't understand the whole... How it works, like, scaled calibration, all that. Like, if I did a GPU for something that needed CPU, would there be any downside or would it just be more expensive but quicker? Okay, so for what best possible view launch should be, give me the database schema for that. Let's model a little bit more of what it's doing. When you say a thousand to five thousand polygons, you have multiple polygons on one set of points with Project 3. What is 300 DPI? For step one, give me the database schema to your list and how it relates to our V1. This looks really, really good and detailed. Do you think that other, you know, bigger ones, big companies like the ones that are out there now, do you think they were able to get it this good with, you know, because AI wasn't as good as it is now? I guess what would be the end goal for it to like, auto-suggest things, like run, you know, spare footage and taking off, and it's like a really good user interface on how to verify or what?Okay, this is a really good goal because, you know, I'm gonna have to have a flooring company help me with it. I'm gonna go to Elite Installation Services. And their estimator does like 15 a day. I think, you know, if I can get them to use this, and I say, look at a minimum, you know, I'll figure out how to eliminate you having to type as much because just with the basic API call now, I can already do like floor plan finishes, et cetera, just by prompting. The goal would be something bigger, right? But yeah, I gotta break it down into like what I can work on without them and then what I need him to do. I guess, you know, I have the New Orleans permit data and I have different types of like complexes or whatever. Maybe I have a few or I do a few to get started and ask him to verify if, you know, if they're down to work together or, you know, if he doesn't, I'll just start scratch with his. But I'd like to kind of get started, you know, so I can build my database tables and all that. But another big thing I want you to think about is like, you know, using Claude code and codex. Like, I don't know how to move Claude code more and how they have agents and skills and all that, like when it comes to development, which, you know, what should I consider building for this? Um, I think that's gonna be the biggest thing for me developing, is having, like, these tools. Okay, so this is version 2. Yeah, I think I know what you mean. So the only difference between V2 and V3 is this, like, significant in errors.

## Turn 14 - Assistant

Yes — the eventual goal would be:

> **AI finds the likely scale/calibration line, proposes the scale, proposes room polygons, proposes finishes, and the estimator verifies/corrects.**

But for **V1**, I would not make AI responsible for scale yet.

V1:

```text
Estimator manually sets scale.
Estimator draws or approves polygons.
System calculates SF.
System stores everything.
```

V2:

```text
AI suggests scale, polygons, room names, finishes.
Estimator verifies/corrects.
```

V3:

```text
System has learned from enough approved corrections that suggestions get much better, especially on messy plans.
```

That is the right progression.

---

# 1. Scale: what should happen eventually?

Eventually, yes, the system should say:

```text
I found a dimension line labeled 20'-0".
The line measures 600 px.
Suggested scale: 30 px per foot.
Confidence: 91%.
```

Then the estimator sees:

```text
Accept scale
Edit scale
Pick different calibration line
```

So the AI is not blindly trusted. It proposes.

The system could find scale from:

```text
scale note: 1/8" = 1'-0"
dimension strings: 20'-0", 10'-6", 35'-0"
known door widths
grid spacing
manual user calibration
```

But **manual calibration should exist forever** because PDFs are weird.

---

# 2. Scale is usually per page or viewport, not per whole project

Do not think:

```text
Project has one scale.
```

Think:

```text
Project has many pages.
Each page may have one or more scale regions.
Each approved polygon uses one scale calibration.
```

Example:

```text
Project: Club4 Bryan

Page A1.01:
Overall Floor Plan
Scale: 1/8" = 1'-0"

Page A1.11:
Enlarged Restroom Plan
Scale: 1/4" = 1'-0"

Page A9.01:
Details
Multiple small drawings, each with different scale
```

So the database should store:

```text
scale_calibrations
- page_id
- applies_to: whole_page or viewport
- point_a_px
- point_b_px
- real_world_distance_ft
- px_per_ft
- confirmed_by_user
```

Then every room/area polygon points to the scale it used:

```text
approved_takeoff_areas
- geometry_px
- scale_calibration_id
- area_sf
```

That way, if the scale was wrong, you can recalculate.

---

# 3. Page title vs page classification

When I say:

```text
Page 1 = floor plan
Page 2 = finish schedule
```

I mean **your app’s classification**, not necessarily the official title.

The PDF may show:

```text
Sheet A1.01 — First Floor Plan
Sheet A6.01 — Finish Schedule
Sheet ID2.10 — Enlarged Locker Room Plan
```

Your app stores both:

```text
sheet_number: A1.01
sheet_title: First Floor Plan
page_type: floor_plan
```

The sheet title comes from the document.

The page type is what your system classifies it as:

```text
floor_plan
finish_schedule
legend
detail
elevation
cover
spec
unknown
```

Why it matters:

```text
floor_plan → takeoff polygons
finish_schedule → extract finish codes/materials
legend → understand symbols/hatches
detail/spec → maybe useful, but usually not main area measurement
```

---

# 4. What you can build without Elite

You can build a lot before the estimator helps.

## You can build without Elite

```text
PDF upload
page rendering
page image viewer
text extraction
vector extraction
debug overlays
manual polygon drawing
scale calibration
area calculation
room/finish assignment UI
database schema
correction logging
CSV/Excel export
basic finish schedule extraction with API calls
```

This means you can build the **measurement machine** yourself.

## You need Elite/the estimator for

```text
What counts as flooring scope?
What areas should be excluded?
How they handle alternates/addenda?
How they group rooms by finish?
What level of accuracy is acceptable?
Whether a polygon is actually correct
Whether a finish assignment is correct
How they want final quantities organized
```

The estimator’s biggest value is not typing data.

The estimator provides **truth**.

Without the estimator, you can build the tool.
With the estimator, you can validate whether the tool is actually useful.

---

# 5. Your New Orleans permit data: useful, but not enough by itself

Permit data can help you find projects, property types, addresses, contractors, maybe documents depending on what is public.

But for training takeoff, you need:

```text
actual plan PDFs
approved polygons
approved room/finish assignments
approved SF
```

So permit data is useful for:

```text
finding sample projects
sourcing public plan sets
building a demo pipeline
targeting potential customers
```

But it does not become training data unless it includes usable drawings and someone verifies the takeoff.

---

# 6. What I would show Elite first

Do not show them “AI will replace your estimator.”

Show them:

> “I built a plan viewer that can upload your PDF, extract finish info, let you set scale, draw rooms, assign finishes, calculate SF, and reduce typing. I want your estimator to help me see where the workflow is wrong.”

The first pitch should be:

```text
I can probably eliminate a lot of manual typing first.
Then we use your corrections to make auto-suggestions better over time.
```

That is believable.

If their estimator does 15 estimates/day, your first measurable goal could be:

```text
Reduce typing and copying by 50%.
Reduce room/finish setup time.
Make takeoff corrections traceable.
Eventually reduce manual tracing time.
```

Do not promise 15/day becomes 100/day yet.

---

# 7. Best possible V1 launch

The best V1 is not fully automatic.

The best V1 is:

> **A fast, traceable takeoff workspace that stores training data while producing useful estimates.**

V1 should include:

```text
1. Upload PDF
2. Render pages
3. Classify pages
4. Extract text
5. Extract vector lines
6. Show page viewer
7. Toggle text/vector layers
8. Set scale manually
9. Draw/edit polygons
10. Assign room name and finish
11. Calculate SF
12. Save approved takeoff areas
13. Log corrections/events
14. Export quantities
```

The most important V1 features are:

```text
scale calibration
polygon editor
area calculation
finish assignment
approved polygon storage
correction logging
```

Because those create your future dataset.

# 10. What does 1,000–5,000 polygons mean?

It does **not** mean 1,000–5,000 projects.

A polygon is one approved measured area.

Example:

```text
Room 101 Sales Office = 1 polygon
Lobby = 1 polygon
Hallway = 1 polygon
Men’s locker tile = 1 polygon
Rubber free weight area = 1 polygon
Turf area = 1 polygon
```

One project might produce:

```text
20 small rooms
10 corridors/common areas
5 wet areas
4 gym zones
= about 39 polygons
```

So:

```text
25 projects × 40 polygons = 1,000 approved polygons
100 projects × 50 polygons = 5,000 approved polygons
```

But variety matters.

```text
1,000 polygons from 3 similar gyms = useful, but narrow.
1,000 polygons from 50 different commercial jobs = much better.
```

# 11. What is 300 DPI?

DPI means “dots per inch.”

For you, it means:

> **How detailed the rendered PDF image is.**

Higher DPI = sharper image but bigger file.

```text
150 DPI = faster preview
200 DPI = decent viewer image
300 DPI = sharper for analysis/OCR/vision
```

So you might store:

```text
preview image: 150 DPI
analysis image: 300 DPI
debug overlay: 300 DPI
```

You do not need the user to understand DPI. It is mostly an internal processing setting.

---

# 12. GPU vs CPU

Using a GPU for a CPU-type task is usually not helpful.

For example, these are CPU tasks:

```text
PDF parsing
text extraction
vector extraction
polygon area calculation
database queries
rule-based geometry
small tabular classifiers
```

A GPU does not make them automatically faster unless the code is written for GPU computation.

Possible downside:

```text
more expensive
more complex deployment
data transfer overhead
harder debugging
no speed gain for small tasks
```

Use GPU/RunPod later for:

```text
image segmentation
object detection
vision model fine-tuning
large image inference jobs
SAM/YOLO/Mask R-CNN style workflows
```

So yes, RunPod is great later. But it should not be the first dependency.

# 13. Claude Code and Codex: how to think about them

Claude Code and Codex are not your production takeoff model.

They are your engineering workers.

Claude Code is an agentic coding tool that can read your codebase, edit files, run commands, and integrate with development tools; Anthropic also supports custom subagents and skills for specialized workflows. citeturn218491search4turn218491search7turn218491search1

Codex is OpenAI’s coding agent for software development; official docs describe it as able to read, edit, and run code, with support for local CLI usage, cloud usage, skills, and project instructions such as `AGENTS.md`. citeturn218491search0turn218491search2turn218491search13turn218491search5turn218491search21

So your structure should be:

```text
You = product architect / estimator workflow designer

Claude Code / Codex = build scripts, UI, tests, database migrations, workers

LLM/VLM APIs = classify pages, extract finish schedules, reason about text

Your app = stores truth and calculates SF

Estimator = verifies/corrects

Future models = trained from stored corrections
```

Do not ask Claude/Codex:

```text
Build an AI takeoff system.
```

Ask:

```text
Build the PDF extraction worker.
Build the scale calibration UI.
Build the polygon editor.
Build the vector overlay viewer.
Build the correction logging table.
Build the evaluation script.
```

---

# 14. Suggested Claude Code / Codex project agents

For this project, I would create specialized development agents or instruction files around responsibilities.

## Agent 1: PDF processing engineer

Owns:

```text
PDF rendering
text extraction
vector extraction
coordinate transforms
debug overlays
```

## Agent 2: Geometry engineer

Owns:

```text
scale calibration math
polygon area calculation
line snapping
candidate polygon generation
IoU/area error evaluation
```

## Agent 3: Frontend takeoff UI engineer

Owns:

```text
page viewer
layer toggles
polygon drawing
vertex editing
room/finish side panel
approval workflow
```

## Agent 4: Database/API engineer

Owns:

```text
schema
migrations
API endpoints
project/page/polygon CRUD
storage paths
auth later
```

## Agent 5: AI extraction engineer

Owns:

```text
page classification
finish schedule extraction
room/finish JSON extraction
confidence scores
prompt tests
```

## Agent 6: ML/data pipeline engineer, later

Owns:

```text
training example export
evaluation sets
small classifiers
COCO export
RunPod training jobs later
```

This keeps the project from becoming a giant mess.

---

# 15. What to build first with Claude/Codex

Here is the exact order.

## Milestone 1: PDF proof of concept

Build:

```text
Input: PDF
Output:
- page images
- text_blocks.json
- vector_entities.json
- debug_overlay.png
```

Success criteria:

```text
You can visually inspect the overlay and see if text/vector extraction lines up.
```

## Milestone 2: database + project upload

Build:

```text
projects
plan_documents
plan_pages
page_images
text_blocks
vector_entities
```

Success criteria:

```text
Upload a PDF and store page/image/text/vector data.
```

## Milestone 3: takeoff viewer

Build:

```text
page image viewer
toggle text boxes
toggle vector lines
zoom/pan
```

Success criteria:

```text
You can inspect a plan page inside the app.
```

## Milestone 4: scale calibration

Build:

```text
click point A
click point B
enter real distance
save px_per_ft
```

Success criteria:

```text
The app converts pixel distance to feet.
```

## Milestone 5: polygon editor

Build:

```text
draw polygon
move vertices
add/delete vertices
assign room/finish
calculate SF
save approved area
```

Success criteria:

```text
You can manually take off a room and get SF.
```

## Milestone 6: finish extraction

Build:

```text
find finish schedule pages
extract finish codes/materials to structured table
let user confirm/edit
```

Success criteria:

```text
Estimator does less typing.
```

## Milestone 7: correction logging

Build:

```text
save every edit event
before/after geometry
reason code
area before/after
```

Success criteria:

```text
Every correction becomes future training data.
```

Only after these should you obsess over V2 automation.

---

# 16. V2 vs V3: is the only difference fewer errors?

Not exactly.

The difference is **how the suggestions are produced**.

## V2 = suggestions from rules + geometry + LLM/VLM APIs

V2 uses:

```text
rules
PDF vectors
text blocks
geometry algorithms
LLM/VLM prompts
manual confidence scoring
```

Example:

```text
The system sees room label inside a closed shape.
It proposes Room 101 = LVT-1 = 842 SF.
```

This can be useful quickly.

## V3 = suggestions from your own accumulated data

V3 uses:

```text
approved polygons
correction events
trained line classifier
trained label matcher
trained polygon scorer
possibly segmentation model
```

Example:

```text
The system has seen 2,000 corrected room polygons.
It has learned which line patterns are walls vs hatches.
It proposes cleaner room polygons on new jobs.
```

So the difference is not just “fewer errors.”

The difference is:

```text
V2 = hand-built automation
V3 = data-trained automation
```

V2 can be good.
V3 can become more defensible and proprietary.

---

# 17. Big companies and AI timing

Yes, bigger companies could build strong systems before today’s AI because the core problem is not only “AI reasoning.”

It is also:

```text
PDF processing
OCR
vector parsing
geometry
UI/UX
human review workflows
large labeled datasets
estimator feedback loops
```

Modern AI gives you an advantage because:

```text
LLMs can extract schedules better.
VLMs can understand page types better.
Claude/Codex can help you build faster.
Foundation models can help with segmentation.
You can prototype with fewer engineers.
```

But the old hard parts remain:

```text
scale
geometry
verification
correction logging
trusted SF
```

That is why your opportunity is not “we have AI, so fully automatic takeoff is solved.”

Your opportunity is:

> **Build the best verification/correction workflow, then use modern AI to make the suggestions better over time.**

---

# 18. End goal

The end goal is:

```text
Upload plan set.
System finds relevant pages.
System extracts finish schedule.
System suggests scale.
System suggests rooms/areas.
System assigns finishes.
Estimator reviews low-confidence items first.
Estimator accepts/edits.
Final SF is approved and traceable.
Corrections train the next version.
```

The product should feel like:

> “The takeoff is already roughed in. I’m just verifying and fixing it.”

Not:

> “I still have to start from scratch.”

That is the real win.

For Elite, the first useful promise is:

```text
Less typing.
Faster setup.
Cleaner finish schedules.
Traceable room-by-room quantities.
Corrections saved for automation.
```

The bigger promise later is:

```text
AI-assisted takeoff that gets better with every job they verify.
```

That is the right path.

---

## Turn 15 - User

Okay, so for v1, let me say I would not make AI responsible for scale yet. I think like in the early version of v1, it's like, I really don't even care what the UI is, like, because I'm just going to be using Claude and Codex to like change it. Like I might ask or have a skill or whatever for them to like auto-suggest what the scale is, and then I approve it, you know, instead of sending like an API call. Just they suggest, I approve, just speed things up, make a better user experience, you know? Okay, when you're saying for V2 that where AI suggests scale, polygons, room names, finishes, etc., I don't know how that works. Like, is that a model we train? Is that an API call, or what? Might need another breakdown of, like, the models we have for each version, how they work, and the options, all that. I need to make sure confidence percentage is an actual formula, not just like a UI thing. Okay, what should I use for a database for this? Like, I've used Supabase before in the past, but I know their free plan isn't gonna work for this. Like, am I gonna have to pay for one no matter what I do? Note that New Orleans permit data has actual plan PDFs. So, I think, like, I'm gonna have a demo for them where I upload a set of plans, and then this is gonna be an API call, gets like four tables or a finished schedule, all that. And like I export to a Google sheet, da-da-da. Let's make a demo, but I'm gonna tell you, like, look at a minimum, you know, I'm gonna help you not have to type as much when you estimate, like, really quickly, but that's where I'd like to go with it, because it's like where we're going with it, you know.

---

## Turn 16 - Assistant

Yes — your instinct is right:

> **Early V1 can still have “AI suggestions,” as long as AI is not the source of truth.**

So instead of saying:

> “No AI in V1,”

the better wording is:

> **V1 has AI-assisted setup, but human-approved measurement.**

That means Claude/Codex/API calls can suggest page types, finish schedules, maybe even scale candidates, but the final trusted data is still:

```text id="h9cyu7"
confirmed page type
confirmed finish table
confirmed scale
approved polygon
approved square footage
```

---

# 1. V1, V2, V3 — what “models” are actually involved?

Think of each version as using different levels of intelligence.

## V1: AI-assisted setup, manual measurement truth

V1 uses mostly:

```text id="uo34lo"
API calls + rules + manual approval
```

### V1 models/tools

```text id="879xlu"
1. Page classifier
   - API call / VLM / LLM
   - Finds floor plans, finish schedules, legends, details

2. Finish schedule extractor
   - API call / LLM
   - Extracts finish codes, room names, materials into tables

3. Scale suggestion helper
   - Maybe API call or rule-based OCR
   - Suggests scale text or dimension line
   - User confirms

4. Manual polygon editor
   - Not AI
   - Human draws/edits room polygons

5. Area calculator
   - Not AI
   - Deterministic math
```

So yes, in V1 you can have Claude/Codex help build a workflow where the system says:

```text id="o3kusu"
Suggested scale: 1/8" = 1'-0"
Found on page A1.01 near bottom right.
Please confirm.
```

or:

```text id="wqupca"
I found a 20'-0" dimension line.
Suggested calibration: 30 px/ft.
Approve?
```

But the user still confirms.

That is fine.

## V2: auto-suggestions for takeoff geometry

V2 uses:

```text id="3jf64p"
rules + geometry + API calls + maybe small CPU ML
```

V2 adds:

```text id="kyaxk6"
1. Auto-classify vector lines
2. Auto-generate candidate polygons
3. Auto-match room labels to polygons
4. Auto-suggest finish assignments
5. Real confidence scoring
6. Correction tracking
```

This does **not** have to be one trained model.

It is more like a pipeline:

```text id="afmhc6"
PDF vector lines
→ line classifier
→ polygon generator
→ text matcher
→ finish matcher
→ confidence formula
→ estimator approval
```

## V3: custom trained models from your own corrections

V3 uses:

```text id="htf26y"
your saved approved polygons + correction events
```

V3 adds trained models like:

```text id="jsk4ld"
1. Trained vector line classifier
2. Trained room-label matcher
3. Trained polygon quality scorer
4. Later: segmentation model for scanned/messy plans
```

V2 is “smart automation.”
V3 is “learned automation from Elite’s corrections.”

---

# 2. So is V2 a trained model or an API call?

It can be either, depending on the task.

Here is the realistic breakdown.

## Page classification

Question:

```text id="dkdkik"
Is this page a floor plan, finish schedule, legend, detail, or cover sheet?
```

V1:

```text id="otfwqt"
LLM/VLM API call
```

V2:

```text id="3s9glm"
LLM/VLM API + cached examples + rules from sheet title
```

V3:

```text id="yeobua"
small custom classifier maybe, but API may still be good enough
```

## Finish schedule extraction

Question:

```text id="mv6cnr"
What are the finish codes, materials, rooms, notes, alternates?
```

V1:

```text id="73xw46"
LLM API call returning structured JSON/tables
```

V2:

```text id="tvhvxf"
LLM API + validation rules + user correction UI
```

V3:

```text id="9n7pdw"
Maybe custom extraction patterns for frequent customers/architects, but still likely API-assisted
```

## Scale suggestion

Question:

```text id="b7ekwr"
What scale applies to this floor plan?
```

V1:

```text id="a8w6lg"
Manual scale, with optional AI suggestion from visible scale text
```

V2:

```text id="a5lqar"
OCR/text extraction + dimension detection + rule-based calibration suggestion
```

V3:

```text id="65h3a4"
trained model or improved heuristic based on confirmed scale history
```

## Polygon suggestion

Question:

```text id="tl3eu7"
What are the likely flooring areas?
```

V1:

```text id="y5yx6b"
Manual polygon drawing
```

V2:

```text id="n5e65l"
vector parsing + geometry rules + maybe SAM/API segmentation
```

V3:

```text id="dzbtnv"
trained segmentation / polygon quality models
```

## Finish assignment to rooms

Question:

```text id="7v3shf"
Which finish belongs to this polygon?
```

V1:

```text id="94w2tv"
User chooses finish from extracted table
```

V2:

```text id="h4izgz"
text-in-polygon matching + finish-code matching + LLM fallback
```

V3:

```text id="4a6wwk"
trained label matcher based on corrected room/finish assignments
```

---

# 3. Confidence percentage should be real, not fake

Correct. Do not use fake confidence like:

```text id="pw7k4n"
Confidence: 87%
```

unless it comes from a real calculation.

For V1/V2, confidence can be a **formula-based score**.

Example for page classification:

```text id="f2uin0"
page_type_confidence =
  0.35 * title_match_score
+ 0.25 * keyword_score
+ 0.20 * visual_layout_score
+ 0.20 * model_confidence_or_parser_score
```

For scale suggestion:

```text id="e1mjfm"
scale_confidence =
  0.30 * scale_text_found
+ 0.25 * dimension_line_detected
+ 0.20 * dimension_text_near_line
+ 0.15 * repeated_dimension_consistency
+ 0.10 * user_history_match
```

For candidate polygon:

```text id="sxv9qn"
polygon_confidence =
  0.25 * closed_shape_score
+ 0.20 * boundary_line_score
+ 0.15 * room_label_inside_score
+ 0.15 * finish_code_inside_score
+ 0.10 * reasonable_area_score
+ 0.10 * low_overlap_score
+ 0.05 * scale_confidence
```

Then store the components:

```sql id="wbkylk"
confidence_scores
- id
- entity_type
- entity_id
- score
- formula_version
- components_json
- created_at
```

Example `components_json`:

```json id="7mwjf2"
{
  "closed_shape_score": 0.92,
  "boundary_line_score": 0.71,
  "room_label_inside_score": 1.0,
  "finish_code_inside_score": 0.6,
  "reasonable_area_score": 0.85,
  "low_overlap_score": 0.9,
  "scale_confidence": 0.95
}
```

That way, confidence is inspectable.

Later, V3 confidence can come from calibrated model probabilities plus your formula.

---

# 4. What database should you use?

For this product, I would use **Postgres + PostGIS**.

You need relational data plus geometry.

You need:

```text id="556lkc"
projects
pages
text blocks
vector entities
scale calibrations
finish tables
candidate polygons
approved polygons
correction events
model versions
```

That maps very naturally to Postgres.

PostGIS is valuable because it adds geospatial/geometry types and functions to Postgres; Supabase supports enabling the PostGIS extension in its dashboard. citeturn963069search1

## Should you use Supabase?

Yes, Supabase is a good fit for the first real version because:

```text id="yka357"
Postgres
PostGIS support
Auth
Storage
APIs
Realtime later if needed
You already know it
```

But yes, you will probably need to pay once you move past a toy demo. Supabase’s current pricing page lists the Pro plan from $25/month, including 8 GB database disk per project and 100 GB file storage, with overage pricing after included amounts. citeturn963069search0 Supabase’s billing docs also list the Free plan database size as 500 MB per project and Pro/Team as 8 GB included per project, then overage per GB. citeturn963069search9

For your use case, the issue is not just database rows. It is file storage:

```text id="ptxbx8"
PDFs
rendered page images
debug overlays
possibly 300 DPI analysis images
JSON extraction outputs
```

Those can get big fast.

## My recommendation

Use this:

```text id="4b42bb"
Supabase Pro for app database/auth/storage while prototyping with Elite.
External object storage later if files get large.
Python worker separately for PDF processing.
```

Alternative:

```text id="a5cjgt"
Neon Postgres + S3/R2 storage + custom auth
```

Neon is a strong serverless Postgres option and its pricing page lists storage pricing on a per-GB-month basis, but it is database-focused, so you would still need object storage and auth separately. citeturn963069search6

Railway is convenient for hosting services; its Pro plan is usage-based with monthly credits and supports larger resource limits, but for your app I would not make Railway the primary geometry database if Supabase/Postgres/PostGIS is already familiar. citeturn963069search7

Clean answer:

> **Start with Supabase Pro + PostGIS. Do not overcomplicate it.**

---

# 5. What to store where

Use the database for structured data:

```text id="b9e7kh"
projects
pages
text blocks
vector entities metadata
scale calibrations
polygons
finish records
correction events
```

Use file storage for big files:

```text id="baur4v"
original PDFs
page PNGs
debug overlays
vector JSON files if huge
training dataset exports
```

In Supabase:

```text id="px8o36"
Postgres tables = truth/metadata
Supabase Storage = files
```

If files become huge later:

```text id="s7ymsd"
Cloudflare R2 or S3 = large file storage
Supabase Postgres = metadata and relationships
```

---

# 6. Your demo for Elite should be simple and believable

Since New Orleans permit data has actual plan PDFs, that is perfect for a demo.

The demo should not try to solve auto-takeoff yet.

The demo should prove:

> “We can reduce typing and organize the takeoff workflow immediately.”

## Demo workflow

```text id="l2067t"
1. Upload a real plan PDF.
2. System classifies pages:
   - floor plans
   - finish schedules
   - legends
   - details
3. API extracts structured tables:
   - sheet index
   - finish schedule
   - room finish list
   - material codes
4. User reviews/edits extracted tables.
5. Export to Google Sheet or internal estimate table.
6. Optional: show page viewer and manual scale/polygon takeoff prototype.
```

That is a strong first demo.

Because you can say:

> “At minimum, this reduces manual typing and setup time. The long-term goal is AI-assisted takeoff where your estimator verifies suggestions instead of starting from scratch.”

That is much more credible than:

> “I built an AI that estimates everything automatically.”

---

# 7. The four tables your API should extract for the demo

When you say “API call gets four tables,” I would choose these:

## Table 1: Sheet index

```text id="tlp15n"
sheet_number
sheet_title
page_number
page_type
confidence
```

Example:

```text id="83q03f"
A1.01 | First Floor Plan | page 4 | floor_plan | 0.92
A6.01 | Finish Schedule | page 12 | finish_schedule | 0.96
```

## Table 2: Finish schedule

```text id="8pa6h5"
finish_code
material_type
description
manufacturer
color
notes
source_page
confidence
```

Example:

```text id="n2zr3a"
LVT-1 | Luxury Vinyl Tile | 5mm glue-down LVT | ... | ... | page 12 | 0.88
RF-1 | Rubber Flooring | 8mm rolled rubber | ... | ... | page 12 | 0.91
```

## Table 3: Room finish matrix

```text id="m5hyqm"
room_number
room_name
floor_finish
base_finish
wall_finish
source_page
confidence
```

Example:

```text id="1x4j94"
101 | Sales Office | LVT-1 | RB-1 | P-1 | page 12 | 0.84
```

## Table 4: Takeoff-ready areas / scope list

This is not final measured SF yet. It is a setup table.

```text id="w5wx5g"
area_or_room_name
room_number
suggested_finish_code
sheet_number
needs_measurement
notes
```

Example:

```text id="nma59o"
Sales Office | 101 | LVT-1 | A1.01 | yes | measure from floor plan
Group Fitness | 112 | RF-1 | A1.01 | yes | verify rubber type
```

This gives them immediate value before auto-polygon measurement.

---

# 8. Google Sheets export for demo

Even if the long-term app does not depend on Google Sheets, export is good for the demo because estimators understand spreadsheets.

Export tabs:

```text id="hhuo2d"
1. Sheet Index
2. Finish Schedule
3. Room Finish Matrix
4. Takeoff Setup
5. Review Flags
```

Review Flags is important:

```text id="fjerev"
source
issue_type
message
confidence
page_number
```

Example:

```text id="rnz8e3"
Finish Schedule | low_confidence | Could not determine material for RF-2 | 0.54 | page 12
```

This makes the API output feel professional.

---

# 9. How to explain the roadmap to Elite

Say it like this:

```text id="ag41qh"
Phase 1 is not replacing the estimator. It is removing typing and setup work.

The system uploads a plan set, finds the relevant pages, extracts finish schedules and room-finish tables, and exports the information in a format your estimator can review.

Phase 2 adds AI-assisted measurement: the system proposes scales, areas, and room/finish assignments. Your estimator verifies and corrects.

Phase 3 learns from those corrections, so the suggestions get better over time on the kinds of plans you actually bid.
```

That is honest and exciting.
